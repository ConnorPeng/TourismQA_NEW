Have seen some good tips on markets, tipping, etc., but some of them are dated several months back. Please advise:1. Reasonable tipping (hotel bellboy, taxi driver, waiters at cafes or restaurants, etc.)2. A good supermarket close to downtown where I can shop for Kenyan-made specialties, especially dry foods.3. An open-air Maasai market for Thursdays.4. A good place to buy ebony artifacts (best if it has good fixed prices, no haggling!)5.Nairobi National Park: is it a walk-in, or do I need to book with a travel service?6. Best place to change money (banks? exchange offices?)7. A good cafe near downtown Nairobi where I can enjoy genuine taste of Kenyan coffee.8. A good restaurant near downtown Nairobi serving Kenyan food.Thanks",

Don&#39;t tip taxi drivers who usually work for themselves and will charge what they can. Tip the waiting staff 10% at a restaurant and people will be pleased. Small change or Ksh50\u2013100 will go down well in bars or caf\u00e9s.2) Any Nakumatt s&#39;market will have plenty of everything, including local dry foods.3) The Maasai markets aren&#39;t currently operating on Thursdays.4) Please don&#39;t buy endangered ebony. It&#39;s the ivory of the plant kingdom.5) Nairobi Nat Park requires a vehicle. Take a taxi for a few hours, or get your hotel to organise a minibus with a pop-up roof.6) Get your cash with a debit card from any ATM.7) Branches of Java are usually good. But only as good as the freshest pot. Ask them to make fresh if it&#39;s stewed. It&#39;s always Kenyan.8) Tell us where your hotel is and someone will recommend a nearby restaurant. You don&#39;t want to be driving across the city to eat.Have a good time!Richard",

This website has some coverage (I&#39;m sure other TA users will be aware of better sources)http://www1.american.edu/ted/ebony.htmAs for ivory and other wild animal products, trade in all of them in Kenya is effectively illegal. That&#39;s obvious in the case of ivory and rhino horn, but the ban also includes sea shells, sea urchin carapaces and other marine animal products \u2013 not that you&#39;d know it from the open way they&#39;re sold on the beaches.Ostrich shells, from farmed birds, are probably okay these days!Anyway, have a great trip.Richard",

People are warm, weather is charmingly cool but traffic still runs on the wrong side of the road!Yaya shopping center (somewhere) and Nakumatt (downtown) were very good.Almost all sellers of wooden artifacts first claim they&#39;re made of ebony, and they give you solid evidence. When I told them I wouldn&#39;t buy ebony (taking a TA expert&#39;s advice!!) and they are about to lose the deal, they then say that (the very same) artifacts are made of tanned rosewood, and again, they give you solid evidence! LOL! Price of course goes down by at least 20% at this point, then you continue to haggle for at least 10-20% more.Had a lot of work to do outside working hours, so unfortunately didn&#39;t have time to visit the Park or any of the museums--have to leave something for the next time.I enjoyedKenyafor this second time (first time was on my honeymoon, over a decade ago) and wish I will be able to visit again.Thank you once again.",

For example, places like theGiraffe Centre,Karen Blixen Museum, Elephant Orphanage, Animal Orphanage andNational Parkare all very close to Karen, on the outskirts. If you were to stay somewhere like, say,Macushla House, you would be located in Langata and therefore within 15-20 minutes&#39; driving time of all of the above, traffic permitting. Then, for the downtown attractions such as theNational Museumand others listed in the previous post, you could organise with your hotel / B&amp;B to hire a taxi plus driver for the day to take you into town and wait while you visit them. Alternatively, you could stay in a downtown hotel and do your sightseeing vice versa. Personally speaking, I&#39;d go for the outskirts option as it&#39;s cheaper and quieter and Nairobi, IMHO, is a pretty grotty city!2.

    "body": "Hello fellow travellers!First off, I wanna thank everyone that already uses this forum, because it has greatly helped us plan other parts of our Africa trip in the past and for the coming year already.We do still have a question regarding accommodation.The following is our itinerary (yes, it&#39;s a bit jam packed for some, but this is partially a business trip doing some research for client travel):July 7 - Fly to Nairobi, Overnight ???July 8 - Drive to Serengeti, ON Speke BayJuly 9 - Full day Serengeti, ON Speke BayJuly 10 - Full day Serengeti, ON Speke BayJuly 11 - Drive back around through Western Masai Mara into Eastern area, 3/4 day in park, ON Sopa LodgeJuly 12 - Full day Masai Mara, ON Sopa LodgeJuly 13 - Morning in Masai Mara, return to Nairobi, flight in evening to JobergWe arrive in Nairobi fromCape Townaround 2:30pm (7th) and are trying to determine what our best option is before driving around into the Serengeti (driving to Speke Bay, which is on the far west edge of the park).Option 1 - Overnight in Nairobi and leave first thing the next morning for the long drive into the Serengeti.We are down to the following 4 locations to stay: Country Lodge, Fairview,Nairobi Safari Club, andNdemi Place. We would do a bit of touring around before settling into our hotel, but are also concerned about safety as the day moves on.Option 2 - Start driving towards Serengeti, but stay somewhere along the way that evening (maybe drive 2-4 hours?). Our concern was finding somewhere safe and reasonable for a quick overnight. Don&#39;t need anything luxury by any means, but we also don&#39;t want to stay in anything budget (again, safety concerns).Any recommedations if there are any places to stay along the way? We planned to take the B3-A1-B6 hwy route around to the lodge.If not, are there any recommendations which location would be best for the overnight inKenya? We might do something like the elephant orphanage or giraffe centre upon arrival.The main purpose of our trip is the self drive in Serengeti and Masai Mara. We were going to stay the entire time in the Masai Mara and drive into the Serengeti, but we found out you cannot drive between parks from within the parks, so we have to go all the way around in order to do both. Unfortunately, the rest of our trip is set and we don&#39;t have much extra time to give to these parks than listed above.The reason we have chosen to drive is because we, have done, and enjoy self driving the parks (might pick up a guide for a day or two when we enter, as this is pretty cheap).Other options like flying into Kilimajaro came out pretty expensive and this is the best we&#39;ve come up with so far.Any suggestions or recommendations would be greatly appreciated. We have doneSouth Africabefore, but never Kenya andTanzania.Thanks again everyone,Mark",

You have an afternoon game drive to airstrip for 4pm flight to Wilson.If you have own driver/vehicle for entire afternoon till drop off at JKIA, and if you do foster a baby chubby from Sheldrick, you can arrange/reserve to visit yours at 5pm where foster parents can, for 1/hr then head off for dinner somewhere.Suggest you compare the extra you would pay for late departure vs the dayroom with the earlier from the Mara... then decide which works better for your budget.",

    "body": "We will be in Nairobi for an afternoon and overnight in mid July. Any suggestions for a decent hotel and restaurant? We will have 2 adults and 2 kids (boys 10 and 15). We will be headed to Masai Mara the next morning. We had been told to eat at the Carnivore but I see reviews that indicate it is not as exotic as it used to be and is also overpriced.Aside from that, what tours or sights to see might you recommend for the afternoon? It had been suggested we see the slum (sorry, forget the name) that is one of the largest in Africa. Not that we want to be tourists here but we will be on our way home fromUgandafrom humanitarian work and might find this educational.Thoughts?",

A great Italian one is Mediterraneo, which has two locations - The Junction Shopping Mall, or in Westlands. For Indian, tryHaandiorOpen Houseboth in Westlands. Japanesse - Tokyo in Westlands.I had dinner at Carnivore on Tuesday, and it was not bad. The experience is still great, and the meat is good (tho no exotic meats).Remember that traffic can be heavy in nairobi, so if you arrive in the aftrenoon, the drive from the airport to the hotel could take up to 2 hours. It would not leave too much time for sight seeing. You could go to Karen and see theGiraffe Centre, Karen Blixen&#39;s House, and do a spot of shopping.",

The only reason i suggest this is because you mentioned your work inUganda. Kibera is not for the average &#39;tourist&#39;.Things are quite bad there and the mere size of the place is unbelievable. 1.5 million people living in a &#39;real&#39; slum. It is the largest in all of africa. There is a spot at a school called &#39;olympic&#39; where you can get a great view of Kibera.Despite the conditions the people, especially the kids, are great.If you can find someone a local that is trustworthy get them to take you through. If you can get them to drive you to an area Jamhuri and then it is a 10min walk to Kibera. If you stay on the outer rim and don&#39;t take valuable you will get a better feel than a drive through. Just don&#39;t go at night. During the day you shouldn&#39;t have any probelms as long as you use common sense. I used to walk to the orphange by myself.Gypsygirl8",

The kids will love this. Fee is $50 to adopt an ellee.Then head to dinner. Carnivore is fun. Tamarind, a bit fancier, but food is excellent. Mediterraneo (Italian) is excellent... there are a few of these around NBO. Nairobi has become a &quot;foodie&quot; city, so there are many cuisines you might find of interest. Your hotel will certainly have a list.",

(about 2-2.5/hrs drive time)OR- Sat morning, road trip to Ol Pejeta, private conservation - stay at Sweetwater&#39;s, Porini Camp or Ol Pejeta Bush Camp (if open in Nov); game drives, night game drives; Sunday, game or walking safaris; return to NBO by evening. (about 2-2.5/hrs drive time).--- Cost for either of these should include: guide/vehicle, park fees, room/tent, meals, game drives and all transfersHope this helps.",

I&#39;d check with Zim Embassy if this inoc is needed which is rather expensive. Also, taxi to/from hotel.And, for a 7:20am flight you have to be at airport for check-in/security at minimum 2/hrs prior departure (it&#39;s an international flight). Thus, gather you&#39;d have to be up, showered, dressed, had breakfast and out of hotel by 5am.While NBO airport isn&#39;t attractive enough nor at all comfortable, services limited... you might do better finding a quiet spot here to catch some Zzzzs.

You do need to keep your windows up - exhaust fumes in crawling or stationary traffic are not pleasant!

If you arrive in daylight, there is a chance of seeing giraffe by the road (over the fence!!) just as you exit the Airport. Otherwise it is traffic, traffic and more traffic.Remember we are almost on the Equator, so there is no twilight - darkness arrives suddenly!",

It is a lovely business hotel on southwest side of city but situated so as 1/2 hour drive (allow 2 hours before check-in) to airport. I had lunch at outdoor restaurant and a nap. There are some street wares just outside of hotel grounds if you want any last minute gifts. Nairobi can be dangerous (traffic bad) so don&#39;t go out with any valuables or not at all. I learned that everything is negotiable so don&#39;t fall for any of the street scams or high price quotes. There are probably day room prices ($80US) that can be negotiated depending on business so check around. The Sarova Pan-Afrik is right behind the Fairview and has a nice pool area.

This way you are sure you are going to be picked up as soon as the flight lands.The choice of hotel then may not necessarily be confined to the proximity of the Airport as you will be dropped to your hotel safely.Having said that there are several options of nearby Airport hotels among them is Panari hotel, Ole Senari relatively new, Hill park hotel, Mvuli Park and many more depending on your budget. At that time it hardly takes twenty min to the city center as its clear all the way hardly any traffic. Its usually twenty Usd one way to the city center in a private transfer cab. Will pm you some choices.Have a hassle free transfer.John",

            "body": "You don&#39;t say whether you are transiting or staying longer? There isn&#39;t an airport shuttle bus - some of the better hotels might offer their own transport which you would have to arrange beforehand. The best thing is to order a private cab to wait for you - the driver will meet you at the barriers just outside the customs check at arrivals.As the OPs have mentioned, traffic at that time of the night is negligible, however if you need to return to the airport the next day to catch a flight allow at least 2 hours to get there, especially in the late afternoon or on Fridays. Even if the normal traffic is okay, quite often something happens (like a police shoot out with gangsters, or the presidential calvalcade, or a political speech at the stadium - all of which have happened to me) which stops traffic for hours on end (which means the cab might have trouble even getting to pick you up, let alone deliver you to the airport).If you are staying for a while, choose a hotel near the city or at Westlands - Westlands is safer I reckon, and there are cafes and restaurants there and at the Sarit Centre so you aren&#39;t stuck at the hotel, plus shops and the Maasai markets (in tin sheds on the corner opposite Sarit Centre) to buy some gifts. (The touts at the markets can be quite pushy though, so maybe team up with someone else if possible.)Jacaranda Hotelis fine and doesn&#39;t charge like a wounded bull.Also check TripAdvisor for guesthouses etc - the Mennonite Guesthouse off Rhapta Road is about 40 mins walk from Westlands shops, for example, but don&#39;t walk at night or evening.Andrews Apartments(also a hotel - at the end of Rhapta Road near St Marys schools) is really nice with a quiet green outlook (ask for a room looking over St Marys parkland) and pool, but not sure of their pricing.Also, maybe make a deal with your cab driver to drive you around for your stay - public transport as we know it doesn&#39;t exist, and can be dangerous. I can recommend Francis from Westline Travel (+254 (0) 724 988 866), or Nellion cabs (+254 (0) 734 354 738), or JimCabs. One way trip from JKIA into town/Westlands will be 1500 shillings - this is the standard. Further out (say to Karen) would be more.",

Have taken all of our nieces and nephews since they were two, and nobody has been sick or felt uncomfortable.If you drive in, your driver will guide you in the Mara. It is such a better experience to have a local guide from the Mara. These guys know the Mara like the back of their hand, have their own networks, etc., and I can 100% guarantee you that your safari experience will be ten folds better with the local guides.Most of the driver guides from Nairobi rely on their radio for calls on what people have seen, and then all rush in for the sighting and then rush on for the next. The local guides avoid the masses, and take you for a truly special safari experience.",

The National Museums are located in the Parklands/Westlands area and the nearest mall, Sarit Centre has a noticeboard where accommodation adverts are posted. The local newspapers also carry ads for accommodation. For longer term property rentals, it is not uncommon for 3 - 6 months deposit to be asked for. Also repainting the accommodation at the end of the tenancy is often a clause in the agreement, which you arrange and fund.I found these, during a quick search:https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/2424954?s=5gsO\u2026capitalfm.co.ke/property/residential-proper\u2026expat-blog.com/en/\u2026flats-for-rent.htmlhttp://www.homestay.com/kenya/nairobiYou have not mentioned your budget, but accommodation in Westlands, particularly can be quite expensive.

A few tuskers in the garden after we arrived went down very well.For our departure, the chap at reception (I think his name was Felix??) rang through to Safarilink to get them to come and pick us up for our 8 am flight (to Lewa Downs).The main attraction for us was the proximity to Wilson, with a focus on an easy connection with Safarilink.

Other highlights are theGiraffe Centrewhere you can feed the giraffes and learn more about them,Karen Blixen Museum(Out of Africa), Bomas of Africa, a cultural village where you will learn about the tribes and watch them perform,Utamaduni Craft Centrefor more up-market crafts. Carnivore Restaurant is also a lot of fun but probably better if you have company. All of these attractions are in Langata an outer suburb of Nairobi, so all close by to each other.I have friends in the safari business in Nairobi who I would recommend to you, but not sure how their cost would compare to other forms of travel for a single person. Please try them.East Africa Discoveries and Safaris, run by Isaac Kariuki, email safari@eastafricad.co.ke OR eastafricad@yahoo.com.www.eastafricad.co.keAsk for David to guide you ... he is also a friend and a wonderful guide, very professional and polite.

I will be traveling (+1 person) from Zanzibar to Nairobi International Airport (with Fly 540, arrival 7.3.2015 at 14:10) from where I will continue toVienna(Turkish airlines, departure from Nairobi is on 8.3.2015 at 4:45 AM)..That means we will have to wait at the airport in Nairobi for more than 14 hours.1. Will I have to pay 50 USD for visa, or can I avoid it by not leaving the international transit lounges?2. Is it advisable to spend that much time at the airport in transit? Are there facilities that would make the waiting worthwhile, or at least tolerable?What would you suggest? Stay in transit / Rent a room for the night / Or find different flights?thanks a lot",

Its difficult to spend that amount of time there, unless you have a tablet or similar loaded with movies!If you want to look for alternative flights; Emirates andQatarhave flights which depart late afternoon/early evening and in my opinion,Dubaiis a more tolerable place to wait (don&#39;t know about the new airport at Doha).If you wanted to get out of the airport, a Transit Visa is valid for 72 hours and costs 10 GBP (or $ equivalent).",

There is the Simba Lounge that you could upgrade to but that is all.My first choice would be to find different flights. Start with routes from ZNZ avoiding NBO sector altogether. Go via DAR so no new Visa required IF a long stay still needed.Or bite the bullet, get a transit Visa and a cheap lodge nearby. Or just see the town and head back to the airport around midnight after a decent meal somewhere.BUT be aware the NBO traffic is horrendous even at that hour.

            "body": "You will have to decide what you are going to do before getting off the plane, because since the fire at the airport in 2013 all international flights are met on the tarmac by buses. There are two sets of buses, one for transit passengers who are taken to the transit area of the Departures Terminals, and the other for people whose destination isKenya, who are taken to the Arrivals Hall.If you choose to leave the airport for a hotel and your bags are checked through to your final destination you will not have access to them, and as said above you will need a transit visa which cost 15\u20ac.There was only one lounge left at the airport after the fire and this was reserved for Kenya Airways (KQ) and it&#39;s Skyteam partners business and first class passengers. Recently a new terminal (1A)was opened which is dedicated to KQ and it&#39;s partners, while passengers of other airlines continue to use the old departure terminal.The new one contains several cafes, bars, restaurants and it will have two new lounges (again restricted to KQ and Skyteam first and business class passengers). The last I heard (November 2014) they had opened one of the new lounges and the other was almost ready to open, but had still retained use of the Simba Lounge in the old departures area, which seems a bit selfish, unless they were going to release it for other airlines once both new ones were open. (Maybe if Mfuwe used the old Simba lounge they have?)You can access the new terminal and its restaurants etc from the old departures area, there is an entrance next to Java House (Coffee / Restaurant / Bar) next to gate 14, although it is airside you still have to go through the scanners again. So you are not limited to Java House and a couple of small cafes like you used to be before the new terminal opened.",

Kenyan&#39;s are too polite to turn down a tip made in US Dollars.

    "body": "I traveled toKenyain August with my wife and two kids (10,12) for a six night safari with AfricaPoint. Overall it was a superb trip, with only one flaw (with the itinerary). The price was very reasonable when compared to what others charge for the same itinerary. Everything was included in the price except for drinks (we did get the company to provide bottled water in the vehicle throughout the trip) and tips. We couldn\u2019t possibly have been happier with our driver/guide Paul. Not only was he a great guide, he also was a careful driver, particularly in the one stretch where the drivers are dangerous. An executive from the company had lunch with us on the last day (while in Nairobi), and he asked for us to provide the pros and cons of the trip. That\u2019s a good sign that they are serious about customer satisfaction. I planned the trip after checking out the lodges on Tripadvisor, and AfricaPoint accomodated me on all my requirements.If you get the chance, head to the Nairobi area in August, which is comfortable weather (mostly in the 70s) and is the peak time for the wildebeest migration in the Masai Mara. The Kenyan winter (if you can call it that) was wonderful after coming from the heat of the Egyptian summer.We arrived at 0300 in Nairobi after an overnighter from Cairo. Someone from AfricaPoint was there to greet us, although he wasn\u2019t carrying a sign, so it took a few minutes to link up. That\u2019s one of the few glitches in the trip. The driver took us to the Panafric Hotel in Nairobi, where we had a good, relaxing breakfast. Paul, our driver/guide, arrived to pick us up around 0800. I was glad to see that the driver on our trip wasn\u2019t the same as the one who picked us up at 0300; having a sleepy driver wouldn\u2019t be a good start. Paul drove us to our first destination at the Serena Mountain Lodge at Mt. Kenya, after a stop at a souvenir store. He recommended that we buy stuff their, saying it was the best bargain around. However, since it was our first day, and we had nothing to compare it to, and hadn\u2019t built up a trust in Paul yet, we only bought a few small items. If you have Mt Kenya as your last stop before Nairobi, that\u2019s the largest store we visited. We arrived at the lodge at lunchtime.The Serena Mountain Lodge was the perfect place to spend our first night in Kenya. After the overnight flight and a 3-4 hour drive, staying at a place where you can see the animals from your lodge was very relaxing. It\u2019s quite a thrill to enter the lodge from the side facing away from the watering hole, and then to see it from the lobby. There were about eight elephants roaming around, plus other animals (details in the hotel section, where we also reviewed the other lodges mentioned below). We also went on a nature walk that included a stop for tea. The rooms, all of which face the watering hole, were comfortable and the meals were great. You can check off a list of animals that you would want to be awakened for, including hyenas and civit cats. Since it\u2019s an older lodge, if you have noisy neighbors, you will need some earplugs. We didn\u2019t have any problems, though.The next day we drove to Lake Nakuru, also approximately a four hour drive, with part of it bone jarring. It\u2019s surprising that the main roads north of the city, where the tourists go, are in such bad shape. The bad part didn\u2019t last too long, though, and after entering the park, we were treated to lots of zebras, monkeys, baboons, buffalos, and could see the millions of pink flamingos on the salt water lake. We stayed in a two-bedroom bungalow at the Sarova Lion Hill, which was a beautiful place with lots of colorful birds and attractive grounds. For the evening game drive, it\u2019s only took about five minutes to get back into the wildlife, which included about a dozen white rhinos, giraffes, lions, wart hogs, and other animals, and white flamingos, great white pelicans, and lots of other birds on the lake. In the evening we enjoyed an African dance troop. The only knock on this lodge was the uncomfortable mattresses, which were everywhere except at the Serena Mountain Lodge. Overall, it was a wonderful second part of the trip.Day three involved another stop at the lake before heading off to the Masai Mara, where we arrived by lunch. As with the trip to Lake Nakuru, there is a rough stretch to this road too. It\u2019s interesting, though, to see the villages en route, including the Masai tribal villages. We spent two nights in two upstairs rooms in a four room bungalow at the Mara Simba Lodge. This is a very open lodge which overlooks a lazy river where hippos, crocodiles, ibises, baboons, monkeys and a large monitor lizard could be seen. We had an afternoon game drive on the first day, and two game drives on our second day there. We saw thousands of wildebeest, lots of lions, and almost every animal that they have in the park, including a leopard up close, and a cheetah. The only disappointment we had was missing out both mornings on a hot air balloon ride due to high winds (a rarity there). We absolutely loved the Masai Mara, since we saw so many animals. Two nights worked out just fine, but you could stay three nights and still benefit. Make sure you try to see a river crossing site for the wildebeests.Day five was the only major mistake on the trip. I had provided the itinerary, planning on driving from the Masai Mara to Amboseli. The company-provided itinerary details showed that we would arrive at Amboseli by lunch. We ended up arriving late in the evening, after a 3-4 hour drive to the capital, where we had a good lunch at the Panafric Hotel again, followed by a drive on the dangerous stretch (lots of fast moving vehicles weaving in and out, and lots of road work) leading from the capital to the south. After about two hours of that bad stretch, we turned off for the road to Amboseli, which had been recently paved and had few other cars on it. That part fine, but the last half hour was on a very dusty stretch that hadn\u2019t been paved yet. We arrived in time for dinner, and were pretty tired. Paul commented that whoever had filled out our itinerary details had clearly never made that trip. The executive that joined us for lunch that day already knew about the glitch and assured us that future customers would be advised to spend the night in Nairobi.We stayed two nights at the Amboseli Sopa Lodge. It\u2019s a beautiful site with nice large, two room bungalows, well manicured gardens, and a little hill where we saw hornbills and mongeese. At nighttime you can return to the hill and see a feeding. They placed meat on a large rock, and then out came a striped hyena (rare, unlike the spotted hyenas you can see in the park), a black badger, a couple of large white-tailed mongeese, and several house cats! The whole menagerie clearly meets each night, and the cats are ignored by the hyena and other critters. When the weather cooperates, you can see Mt. Kilimanjaro from the lodge. On our last morning there, out popped the mountain for about 1.5 hours, before entirely disappearing from sight. The meals at this lodge were fine, but not as good as at the other places. The park is not as interesting as the Masai Mara. We saw many of the same animals, with the major benefit being the elephants up close (we saw them up close at the Serena Mountain Lodge, but not up close at Masai Mara), quite a few hyenas, several types of eagles, and other birds that we hadn\u2019t seen before.Our trip back to Nairobi was uneventful. We had a very late night flight, so we opted for a visit to the animal orphanage, which was a disappointment. We thought we would see baby animals, but the orphanage is where animals are brought as young, but kept for the rest of their lives. Since you will see most of these animals in the wild, this is no more exciting than visiting a zoo. Although we didn\u2019t do it, I would imagine that the Village Market is the place to go to get your last-minute souvenirs. We ended up having dinner at the Carnivore Restaurant, which we highly recommend.Bottom line from this trip. We had the best vacation of our lives (and that\u2019s saying something, since I\u2019ve been many places). The itinerary was almost perfect, the weather was great, AfricaPoint was reasonably priced, and Paul was truly outstanding as a driver and guide. We highly recommend AfricaPoint. If you have some extra money, consider asking for a Range Rover, which is probably more comfortable on the sections of rough road than the standard minibus. It\u2019s not a big deal, though; we were certainly satisfied with the minibus.",

We saw thousands of wildebeest, lots of lions, and almost every animal that they have in the park, including a leopard up close, and a cheetah. The only disappointment we had was missing out both mornings on a hot air balloon ride due to high winds (a rarity there). We absolutely loved the Masai Mara, since we saw so many animals. Two nights worked out just fine, but you could stay three nights and still benefit. Make sure you try to see a river crossing site for the wildebeests.Day five was the only major mistake on the trip. I had provided the itinerary, planning on driving from the Masai Mara to Amboseli. The company-provided itinerary details showed that we would arrive at Amboseli by lunch. We ended up arriving late in the evening, after a 3-4 hour drive to the capital, where we had a good lunch at the Panafric Hotel again, followed by a drive on the dangerous stretch (lots of fast moving vehicles weaving in and out, and lots of road work) leading from the capital to the south. After about two hours of that bad stretch, we turned off for the road to Amboseli, which had been recently paved and had few other cars on it. That part fine, but the last half hour was on a very dusty stretch that hadn\u2019t been paved yet. We arrived in time for dinner, and were pretty tired. Paul commented that whoever had filled out our itinerary details had clearly never made that trip. The executive that joined us for lunch that day already knew about the glitch and assured us that future customers would be advised to spend the night in Nairobi.We stayed two nights at the Amboseli Sopa Lodge. It\u2019s a beautiful site with nice large, two room bungalows, well manicured gardens, and a little hill where we saw hornbills and mongeese. At nighttime you can return to the hill and see a feeding. They placed meat on a large rock, and then out came a striped hyena (rare, unlike the spotted hyenas you can see in the park), a black badger, a couple of large white-tailed mongeese, and several house cats! The whole menagerie clearly meets each night, and the cats are ignored by the hyena and other critters. When the weather cooperates, you can see Mt. Kilimanjaro from the lodge. On our last morning there, out popped the mountain for about 1.5 hours, before entirely disappearing from sight. The meals at this lodge were fine, but not as good as at the other places. The park is not as interesting as the Masai Mara. We saw many of the same animals, with the major benefit being the elephants up close (we saw them up close at the Serena Mountain Lodge, but not up close at Masai Mara), quite a few hyenas, several types of eagles, and other birds that we hadn\u2019t seen before.Our trip back to Nairobi was uneventful. We had a very late night flight, so we opted for a visit to the animal orphanage, which was a disappointment. We thought we would see baby animals, but the orphanage is where animals are brought as young, but kept for the rest of their lives. Since you will see most of these animals in the wild, this is no more exciting than visiting a zoo. Although we didn\u2019t do it, I would imagine that the Village Market is the place to go to get your last-minute souvenirs. We ended up having dinner at the Carnivore Restaurant, which we highly recommend.Bottom line from this trip. We had the best vacation of our lives (and that\u2019s saying something, since I\u2019ve been many places). The itinerary was almost perfect, the weather was great, AfricaPoint was reasonably priced, and Paul was truly outstanding as a driver and guide. We highly recommend AfricaPoint. If you have some extra money, consider asking for a Range Rover, which is probably more comfortable on the sections of rough road than the standard minibus. It\u2019s not a big deal, though; we were certainly satisfied with the minibus.",

    "body": "Hi all,I have a day in Nairobi before my safari. I arrive at the airport approximately 6:50 AM and depart for the safari early next morning, giving me a full day in Nairobi. My top two sights to see are the elephant orphanage (from 10-11 Am only) and the Giraffe centre/manor.My safari company has offered to provide me with a driver/car for the day. The charge is quite stiff, it&#39;s over 100 USD because I&#39;m billed at the rate of a single person in a van!I&#39;m wondering how feasible it is to take taxis to get around Nairobi? The safari company will pick me up at the airport and take me to the hotel. Is it realistic to simply hire taxis to get me from the hotel to the two destinations I want to see? My hotel isn&#39;t far from the giraffe centre, but I&#39;m not sure how far it is from the elephant orphanage. What&#39;s the general cost of taxis? (I&#39;m trying to compare the combined cost/convenience of taxis versus having a van and driver at my call all day).All suggestions and advice are greatly welcomed. I am eagerly looking forward to this trip!",

Anyone else think the post-fire JKIA is infinitely better than the pre-fire version?!I&#39;d have no hesitation in recommending people treat NBO as a regular, efficient airport. Limited facilities, admittedly, but ATMs and SIM card shops are all working fine.Pam, your question about early/late dilemma, it will depend somewhat on whether you&#39;re travelling weekday or weekend. A 7pm flight means a roughly 5pm check-in. I&#39;d be leaving Lake Naivasha (depending slightly where at the lake) no later than 1pm. You might be at the airport at 3.30, but if you left at 2.30, you might not make it in time.

    "body": "Hello all!Any ideas are very welcome...We will be arriving back in Nairobi from a 5 day safari and thought it would be nice to spend a night in Nairobi before heading for the overnight train to Mombasa - just to break up the journey a bit.We had provisionally booked a room atGiraffe Manor, fancying somewhere rather extravagant to stay for the night, but were very surprised when they informed us by email that we would have to find something to do in the day before the train as we would have to vacate the manor (i.e. not just the room!) by 10am!We wont be arriving back into Nairobi from the Masai Mara until mid to late afternoon for our overnight stay, so it is too much of a bitter pill to swallow to pay such a lot of money for just the one night in the circumstances. I had assumed that they would at least be able to accommodate storing bags and perhaps a cup of tea when we came back to collect the bags before the train, given that it was going to cost in the region of \u00a3550 for the night for two people.So... I am now debating between either biting the bullet and getting the overnight train a night earlier, or still staying overnight in Nairobi to break up the journey, but somewhere else.Any recommendations? We had fancied Giraffe Manor as a bit of an indulgence, opportunity to get &quot;up close and personal&quot; with the giraffes there, and be able to have a nice afternoon tea, but have been rather put off by their responses over email... We were going to use the arrival day to relax/enjoy nice surroundings after a few days camping, and then use the following day to visit the elephant orphanage/Giraffe centre before the train, so had also been rather sold on the lack of time in a taxi!Thanks ahead of time for any tips/advice!",

I&#39;ve only blown the budget to this degree on a couple of occasions (Lake Palace inUdaipur/Dorchester in London and the like) when it seems &quot;justified&quot; and on these occasions have got myself comfortable with spending so much money by knowing that I would be able to enjoy the surroundings the next day to some degree along with doing the requisite sightseeing. In my (very limited) experience when you spend that kind of money on a nights&#39; accommodation places usually bend over backwards on the customer services stakes.I hadn&#39;t really considered trying to get a day room as I&#39;d only really expected them to store baggage somewhere and perhaps allow us to sit in communal areas to relax with a cup of tea for half an hour when picking up the luggage in between sightseeing and heading to the train.I&#39;ll have a think about what is best... I guess the choices are either biting the bullet, still staying atGiraffe Manorand dealing with the issue of left luggage/karting it around Nairobi at the time or (like you say) just finding somewhere to chill out a bit before the train and head straight out to the coast the same day.",

It simply isn&#39;t a hotel in any kind of conventional sense, so it&#39;s really not a question of &#39;bending over backwards in the customer services stakes&#39;. Personally, I thought it was a wonderful - and wonderfully unique - place which was worth every penny, but it definitely isn&#39;t a Dorchester/Lake Palace kind of establishment if that&#39;s what you are expecting. If you do decide to stay there, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll see why it really wouldn&#39;t work to have ex-guests coming and going during the day.",

As I recall, they do offer a half-board rate for people who can&#39;t get there in time for lunch - but I don&#39;t think that it cuts the cost by very much - as well as an expensive day-room rate, as 4sandi said. Although we did have to vacate our room by 10am next morning, we certainly weren&#39;t rushed off the premises - in practice, we were welcome to have another coffee on the terrace and actually left around 10:45 (as the first of next day&#39;s guests were arriving). Incidentally, we used GM to book a car for us (at a reasonable price) to use on our departure day: by the time we had been to the elephant orphanage, the Karen Blixen museum, had some lunch, done some shopping, been back to the orphanage to say goodnight to our adopted ele and driven into town it was about 7pm - could that work with the Mombasa train?Edited: 12 January 2011, 04:48",

    "body": "I needed a place to stay with my family for 4 weeks as we moved to Nairobi. We booked Oasis B&amp;B on-line, as it was one of the very few places in the vicinity of where we wanted to be. I found it very expensive for what it offered - essentially, a rustic place - too close to a busy road, and quite gloomy / dark. Not even a bedside table with bedside reading lamp, just a hanging light bulb in the room, mattresses were old and deformed, louvered type windows letting in the mosquitoes. The aging owners were friendly, but it was obvious that they were not putting any money back into the upkeep/upgrading of their place. It has some potential, but without re-investment, or without at least a 50% price reduction to reflect the appropriate value, it cannot be recommended.After 5 days, we inspected Hob House B&amp;B - for nearly the same price, we found ourselves in a modern and very cozy, bright and very well furnished home in a much quieter neighbourhood, with a very nice backyard terrace. The owners were very warm and engaging and helped us find our way around - even taking the family outings and to local restaurants. Highly recommended.Warmest regards,Heather BlenkironEdited: 02 February 2014, 09:58",

On the whole, the town centre is as safe as Nairobi. We started in Ngoingwa before it became too developed, but crime increased sharply and eventually we were broken into. Although there are some nice houses in Ngoingwa, there are also lots of one room houses and temporary structures - I wouldn&#39;t recommend living there.We moved to Bendor Estate, which is in the north of the town. This is one of the more secure estates in Thika (it has a security barrier) and is well worth considering - very little crime. There is a mix of Kenyans and Kenyan Indians living there.There is a big Indian community in Section 9. Maki, Maporomoko and (a little further from town) Bahati Ridge are all areas worth considering as good areas in which to live.Thika is an industrial town and since the highway linking it to Nairobi was completed, its become very popular with commuters looking to move away from the city. Unfortunately, the road network into Thika itself hasn&#39;t been upgraded at the same pace, so traffic into/out of the town centre is horrendous for large parts of the day (except for Sunday). Parking in the town centre is challenging. There are lots of Tuk Tuk&#39;s which can usually bypass the worst of the traffic.Thika is at slightly lower altitude than Nairobi (around 5300ft) and is noticeably warmer and drier (although the water supply is more reliable than Nairobi&#39;s).As for chocolate -Kenyaisn&#39;t a cocoa growing nation and quality chocolate is difficult to find outside Nairobi.",

Are there any checks I can do just to ensure that the details I&#39;ve been given to transfer to are right other than ringing the bank? Has anyone booked through them before, they appear to have been around since 1999.

The police threw my luggage out of the vehicle in pouring rain and I had to sit and swat flies and mosquitoes in horribly hot weather for the entire time. Furthermore, I lost a whole day of my vacation and it took them 2 days to come up with an alternative means of transport. Thank god I had my own personal driver otherwise I would have been in a horrible situation. Getting replacement cars took my driver the bulk of an evening that involved one call then another then another. The whole process was suspicious and shady. The customer service, while they did make an effort, I consider horrible and they compensated me only $50 for the loss of a priceless day of my holiday. Overall, they tried to compensate me for days lost (by not charging for a vehicle for the day it was seized and partially crediting me for extremely dilapidated substitute non-4WD cars. In America, this debacle would result in a full refund, but in this case, absolutely not. I&#39;d never use them again because they seem to not have their own fleet of vehicles but hire them from random Kenyan private citizens that may or may not be legitimate. Beware of them!",

Make sure you either wear something that you don&#39;t care about because they can splash the mud on you but fun to watch. The evening visit from 5-6pm, for those that have adopted ellies, is a different experience and very enjoyable. You get to meet the keepers and see your adopted chubby.Kazuri beads is also great. The tour of the bead making area is very interesting and the ladies very proud of their work. Their finished products are very reasonable in cost here. If you buy the same type of items at lodging, they are way more expensive.Utmanduni Crafts is also in the Karen area and is a great place to have lunch and shop. There is no pressure on the shopping like other places you might encounter. You can browse and bring your items to a central checkout. Prices are slightly higher than booths along the road, but it is wonderful to not have to haggle. They have clean bathrooms and their food is good and very reasonable.Laurena",

As for the Carnivore. . . enormous, no longer does game meat (unless you count chewy crocodile, okay camel and tasty ostrich), but the roast meat does just keep coming, and everyone enjoys themselves.From what you&#39;re saying, if you have the choice, I would stay at the Fairview and try the Blue Nile one evening - they do a so-called &quot;mix dish&quot; where you get to try lots of different food, not just Ethiopian, though that is the main style. Habesha is another Ethiopian place nearby that gets great feedback.Hope that&#39;s a help.Richard",

Pack an abundance of patience, and have a good look at where you are going, the routes and alternative routes before you depart, sitting with a Map of NBO will pass a few hours on the flight!The traffic can be bordering \u2018evil\u2019 at times, so give yourself plenty, and I really do mean plenty of time if you are heading somewhere for a specific time.I too would advise a driver with their own vehicle for a day, you have no worries about parking, security of the car and the routes, they know all the short cuts you would not find, etc. Their fees, so I have read, I have never used them myself, probably don\u2019t add up to much more than car hire and fuel!If you intend to head off beyond NBO, shout again, I am sure there is much we can all add about driving outside the City.",

Do you have another city that you can compare it to?Bangkok, KL, Cairo and Mumbai are my reference points in order of ascending chaos!The reason we are considering car hire is primarily to enable us to do theNairobi National Parkin our own time at our own speed. We would use the car to get from airport to Karen mid-afternoon Friday, and after that maybe to go one place in the area to do some birding if time permits. Early morning to the Park (to be there when it opens) and then if we do not spend the full day in the park to go to one or more of the following:Karura Forest, Ngong Forest,Giraffe Centrenature trail, Arboretum. I am assuming the 1st 3 are easier options wrt traffic. Back to Karen and then early morning to JK airport to be there for 7am (Sunday).Your thoughts appreciated.",

            "body": "Yacht,I supposeBangkokis a fair comparison.If you are only going between Jomo and Karen, with a few trips for birds and NBO Park, I cannot see you encountering any major problems. The Park is off Langata Rd, which is what you will use to get to Keran from Jomo. At the moment there are some works going on there, so it is a little more depressing than usual, but no world shattering.Also, the Park is one of those on the \u2018Card system\u2019, you could actually stop and do all the paperwork the day before going in, thus making entry quicker on the morning you visit. Sometimes there can be a queue at the desk, and anything you can do to avoid it gives you more time actually in there! Ideally, you want to hit the Gate at 0630ish.I would also opt for Ngong over Karuru forest, nothing to do with the birds, I don\u2019t know enough, just that the latter is over by Muthaiga and you\u2019d have to battle through town!If you come out early, and are puckish, there is a reasonable place to eat just by the Gift Shop, then you can get back on the road to theGiraffe Centre, that has a small Caf\u00e9 too, but is really form emergency eats! You may also wish to consider the Elephant Orphange, also in the area, time dependant.For a good feed in the evening, I would head for theTalisman, excellent place about 2 mins from Karen Shops, get your hotel to book a table though, it can get a little busy and try to eat on the Patio, it makes for a nice evening.Do beware, particularly when heading into the road-works on Langata of Matatus, they don\u2019t take prisoners and will when the traffic merges attempt to push you off the road to make space for themselves. For a first time driver over there, I would say bow out gracefully and let them in, it is better than ending up in the ditch.Be lucky and enjoy!",

There&#39;s not much point in renting for such a short time, IMHO. Not to be a downer on the plan. And there are no standard car-rental outlets at the airport.Richard Trillo",

    "body": "Greetings, We (2 adults) have the opportunity to stay atGiraffe Manorfor one day and night in October. We will be arriving at the airport NBO at 6:25 in the morning and head directly to GM for breakfast with the giraffes. Does anyone know how long the giraffes stick around for breakfast? Also, we want to minimize our touring so we can relax and enjoy GM - any suggestions? We will go to Sheldrick Elephant orphanage in the evening to visit our adoptee - is it worthwhile to also go during the noon public viewing? We will also go to the Giraffe Center. Of the following other options, which do you think should be done during our stay at GM and which can be postponed to the day we check out? Karen Blixen museum, bomas, Matt Bronze, Kazuki beads, open air market - which one? Thanks",

            "body": "Hello,I work withGiraffe Manoras their sales and marketing representative in Europe and hope I can help here. The giraffe visit the Manor in the morning until around 8am. It is difficult to say exactly where they will be and when as they have the whole garden to explore throughout the day, but it is safe to say that you will see them before 8am up at the Manor and also around tea time when they like to come up again! I have arrived at the manor at various times of the day and there is almost always a giraffe in sight , be it by the Manor or just down the hill.Re: what to do, you can walk to the giraffe centre from the Manor so, as you say this is a must. I would suggest going to the private session only at the Daphne Sheldrick orphanage. This is far more personalised and you will be able to ask specific questions about your elephant as well as seeing some of the others. The afternoon session can have as many as 150 people there and, although interesting for those who are not able to have a private viewing, is not as special. I would suggest that, as your time is short that you only do the private session.Depending on what you are most interested in, whilst you are coming back from the Daphne Sheldrick orphanage I would highly recommend stopping in at Marula studios. This is where they recycle flipflops from the Kenyan coast (they are washed up onto the beach and turtles have been killed by trying to eat them so they are removed and brought to Nairobi). Here they are made into all sorts of wonderful things such as toys, jewellery, mats etc. You can look around the factory and then head into the shop to see the end products. Kazuri beads is great for souvenir shopping and Matt Bronze is great to visit / see the bronzes being made and buy something of quality. Karen Blixen is also nice to see if you are interested in her history, but again, depending on your time you may want to get back to the Manor. You really do not want to miss out on the tea on the lawn with giraffe! Once you are back at the Manor you can enjoy the rest of the day / evening there. What is great is that the Manor is close to all these places, so it really comes down to your own preference. Hope this helps and you have a wonderful time there!",

It&#39;s 28km from Nairobi International Airport and assuming you&#39;re out of the airport and moving in a vehicle by 7.30am (pretty good going if you are), you won&#39;t be at Giraffe Manor until 9 or 9.30am, except possibly on a Sunday. BUT, you won&#39;t be able to check-in until 10.45/11am for the reasons Sandi states - there&#39;s no waiting area, no lobby and they&#39;re checking guests *out* between 10 and 11. So, you&#39;ll be hanging around for a bit, possibly at the AFEW Giraffe Centre itself (to which as guests of GM you would have free access, though possibly only once you&#39;ve checked in\u2026), which is just across the lawn, on the edge of the manor grounds.The bigger question is: if you aren&#39;t already holding a room at Giraffe Manor, book one soon. It&#39;s often full.As for the question of how to fill the 24 hours: &quot;Karen Blixen museum, bomas, Matt Bronze, Kazuki beads, open air market - which one?&quot; Kazuri Beads is nice, but I wouldn&#39;t pass up the opportunity to visitNairobi National Parkproperly - it&#39;s a really impressive 60 square miles of wilderness, not some sanitised city park, and you have a very good chance of seeing lions, and even greater chance (amazingly) of seeing both black and white rhinos.Have a great stay in Nairobi - a greatly underrated city.Richard Trillo",

The recycled flipflop place sounded neat as well.Not sure what you are doing about getting around to these places but we have used the same driver several times and he does a wonderful job. Waits patiently at the airport for us to clear immigration and get visas and helps me plan our day and keeps us on a schedule. The traffic is horrible in Nairobi and you can be stuck for hours, that it why it is necessary to make sure your driver is familiar with the road situation.

Lazizi give you a room for 24 hrs, whereas other hotels will ask you to check out by 10.00 am. This allows you to do your half day, then hotel to freshen up, pack, and a very short ride to the airport.",

Its too late to change plans now, so the best I can do is make sure that my kid is healthy, relatively well entertained and happy!

Bottle water all the way, hats, sunscreen and short days and you will be fine. If you have not already, be sure to visit travel clinic and get antibiotic prescriptions filled ahead for all travellers and take with you for emergency. We were there for 35 days and used ours.Don&#39;t expect to be taking a stroller as it will be useless on the poor roads, sidewalks except maybe in downtown Nairobi. Back pack carrier for that age might be useful. But taxis and guide will get you wherever you need to go so you should not have to carry that much.And to compare, we also went to India for 60 days when youngest was at the around same age as yours.Kenyais much cleaner and safer than crowed India.",

Not all camps/lodges have these as they&#39;re not always necessary, but I sure would for a little one. And for certain be sure to give him/her their malaria meds daily. There are a few types, but Malarone does have a pediatric dosage for child under 40lbs. Discuss with doc meds and inocs that all might need as even most adults haven&#39;t been since childhood - Tetanus, HepA, Polio.Besides forgetting about a stroller, know that most safari vehicles have seat belts but NOT childseats, so you might want to seriously consider one as the roads in some areas aren&#39;t the best. The little one will also often need a nap midday, so having one is best.Also be aware that you can arrange for an anya ( nanny, reasonably priced ) if you wish your own time, as a quiet dinner. Remember though that those younger than 4/yrs rarely remember the experience... sure from photos within a year or two after the trip, but by 6-7/yrs, it&#39;ll be long forgotten.As you&#39;ll have own guide/driver you&#39;ll be able to set your own schedule.

Several doses of strong antibiotics, water with electrolytes and soda water and 24 hours later all was fine and forgotten.We loved India as my wife has family there. Travelled the southern third and then the golden triangle. India is great for travel with hiring drivers and cars for ten days at a time and with kids it was much cheaper than private safari in Africa.

We are intrigued by history but not huge art or artifact museum fans. We are fairly active, like to be on the water and are curious foodies.

We also asked our driver to take us to a shopping center so we could buy some snacks and drinks. He also took us by the slums of Nairobi (Kibera). I wish we would have spent more time in the slums. The people there were so friendly and the living conditions were so much different than what we see in America.We also changed money at a bank at the &quot;mall.&quot; This bank had a much better exchange rate than we got at the hotel. Also, it is better to haveKenyashillings for the Elephant orphanage and the Giraffe center.

Can we get this in and is it worth doing?Hotels:We see that both theMacushla HouseandCentral Park Hotelare recommended. The Maushla House is $230 per night whereas the Central Park Hotel is $70 a night (for 2 persons). The Macushla House looks lovely but I am not sure I can convince the other half that it is worth paying the extra.We can afford the MH but just wondered what your thoughts are on staying at either; pro&#39;s or con&#39;s., given itinery and safety etc.If you think staying at theCentral Parkis fine from a safety/location point of view and getting taxi&#39;s etc to each of the locations we want to visit wont cost the earth, perhaps we should just stay there?Any thoughts appreciated - sorry just realised I have now written an essay!",

I would leave Village Market out, and go to The Junction which is closer to Karen.Again KICC on a Friday afternoon means gridlocked traffic. You may end up spending a few hours in traffic to move 2 km. It is not really worth it.On Friday go to The Junction, and have dinner at Carnivore.

If the hotel can arrange something decent, and you are picky with cars, maybe it is worth it.I often arrange for taxis to pick me up, or I go to one of the taxi offices (forgot the name) at the airport. You go to the right at the international arrival, to the exit (it is an exit straight ahead, to the left and to the right. Go to the right). Go just outside the door and to the left (2-3 meters).

People unfamiliar with their surroundings (it seems) are more commonly victims of crime/petty theft. Not to scare you, but I&#39;ve heard so many stories (and never been a crime victim myself because I&#39;m overly-cautious) so I think you should heed my advise. You would be best-served to take a bus or shuttle the next morning and grab a hotel on Sunday. You will route through Arusha and then onward to Moshi. The Impala shuttle is comfortablehttp://www.impalashuttle.com/and will get you to Moshi. Riverside shuttle is another option, but there have been a few bad reviews on this forum latelyhttp://www.riverside-shuttle.com/.I can&#39;t speak for Scandinavian, as the quality of buses change from year to year or month to month. It used to look decent (haven&#39;t ever taken them myself) but that can change quickly. I like the shuttles, and they are pretty comfortable compared to the buses. Again a bus in Kenya cannot be compared to a bus in the US.Good luck.",

It&#39;s generally safe to walk around the downtown area in the daytime, but check with the hotel staff and see what they advise.

You can also visit further places other than there e.g. the bubbling hot springs of Lake Bogoria or Amboseli tour or thompson falls in aberdaresThere are tons of other places you can visit. Yeah its pretty safe during the day. At night is not very safe in some areas However it is usually better to have a designated guide who can ensure you dont waste time wound up looking for places around the town. Even with your guide, you can travel safely at night. These guys can help you they are at a site called ealuxuryshuttle.com for advice and more trips and packages.

Nearby is a place called Sheldricks Elephant Orphanage. It is only open from 11-12 and they bring out baby elephants that they are caring for. At theNairobi National Parkyou can do a few things. Firstly, you can go by car and drive around the park looking at all the animals. This was our first &quot;safari&quot; experience and we thought it was great. We were there all day, though. You get a 24 hour pass so you could come and go I think. Also at the park is the safari walk which is fun and also the animal orphange which is interesting as well. You have to pay for each place. It&#39;s $40US for the park and I think $10 each for the other two.All of these places are on the way to Karen where theKaren Blixen Museumis. I haven&#39;t been there yet, but plan to go. The area is very green and picturesque. We haven&#39;t been to Carnivore&#39;s yet but there is a neat bar called Casablancas in the Kilimani area. It has an outdoor area with open fires and chairs around them. Well worth a visit.Anyway, hope this helps and you have fun.",

Last stop can be Sheldrick Orphanage for foster parents.At Kazuri there are items at all prices, few very inexpensive and $20 might be cutting it close. What I like as gifts and reasonaly priced - the wire necklace or bracelet with beads along wire with matching earrings. Trying to find beads that match for a &#39;set&#39; can often be a challenge, so bring your patience. Found these to be the most reasonaby priced.

You can hand pick beads and I was able to find, with the help of the ladies, matching ones for earrings. It&#39;s harder to find matching ones to make a necklace. I bought several beads on my last trip, that didn&#39;t match, but I loved the colors, and they were very inexpensive (about 35-50 cents each) and I have them in a small, clear vase.At the Sheldrick orphanage, they have a small area set up where you can purchase items such as t shirts (and they have the various sizes of different designs hanging up so you can see the size) but they are nicely packaged in plastic so the dust from the ellies doesn&#39;t get them dirty. They take USD as well.I didn&#39;t see a gift shop when I visited Blixen museum in 2009 but that could have changed.Laurena",

They do not do factory tours (which was extremely interesting to me) on Sundays.If this day is following a safari, IMHO, skipping the giraffe center would be an option. You will have seen giraffes already and they will be truly in the wild. A lot of people seem to like the giraffe center because you can touch the giraffe or &#39;get a kiss&#39; from one. But to me, it was more like going to a zoo and it can be quite crowded.Seeing the elephants at the orphanage twice is great (provided as Sandi said you have adopted one) because what they do at the two times is different.

Is it feasble given the time I have? Should i use an organised safari company or a local taxi?Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Each site has a small entry free from a few hundredKenyashillings to, I believe, $40 for theNational Park.Leaving the airport during rush hour it can take you a short 45/min (unlikely) or long 2/hrs to get to your first stop for opening, i.e., Nairobi NP.Deplaning, you have to purchase a Transit Visa $20, suggest you withdraw from ATM some local currency to cover your fees, then go out and find a taxi (negotiate the fare for 4/hrs) for driver to take you to these sites, wait for you and return you to airport by 2pm.I&#39;m sure others will have additional input.

We came across at least 10 dead buffalo and 1 dead rhino they were moving with bulldozers :( There are not many flamingos there anymore either because the lake is flooded and it&#39;s hard for them to wade in the marshes that were once there. However, the scenery was very green and beautiful.Check out Odyssey Safaris and request Erastus (he is awesome and waited 2 hours for us at the airport!) - they should be able to do a trip tailored to what you request.http://www.odysseysafaris.comEdited: 20 July 2015, 12:42",

I&#39;m assuming that we&#39;d prefer to be on the first-floor (UK-speak) i.e. second-floor (US-speak) and to be overlooking the front &#39;garden&#39; - but I&#39;ve only been able to find the names of the 6 rooms, not their locations or their relative merits. If anyone has any opinions as to which rooms work best (or worst....) I&#39;d be very grateful.I&#39;ve also seen a suggestion that - because of the extra food on offer during most of the day at the adjacentGiraffe Centre- giraffes only tend to gather at Giraffe Manor around breakfast-time and in late afternoon.

Bathroom is adjacent with tub-shower/washbasin, next to that is room with the commode/loo. Behind that is another bedroom with queen (or maybe king) sized bed. So both sleeping rooms share the same bathroom/loo. Don&#39;t know the names of either of these rooms, but would be good for a family to share.Believe it&#39;s the same on other side of the Mansion with similar setup.

I think it was also the 1st picture on the accommodation page - we had Giraffe with their heads through our window!! I would mention that as it is art-dec bathroom there was not shower head for me to wash my hair so I did use a shower next door to our room instead.Our friends had the bedroom the other side and their bathroom was not on-suite but just across the hall but the angle of the hall meant no one could see them making the step across. And their bedroom was also lovelyAs far as I remember I would have been happy to stay in any of the rooms but think I was in the best.As for Giraffe they mainly stopped by at breakfast and tea but on one day we did have them visit at lunchtime - we did make use of the car and driver though and go to the elephant orphanage which is just down the road so we were not there all the time.....we also visited the Giraffe centre and went for a walk in their small nature reserve across the road, which is also included in the cost of a night stay, so you can see as much of the giraffes as you want.Please let me know if you have any more questions......is it worth the cost...well the 4 of us thought so!!",

What is now Jock\u2019s Room (ex-Morning Room) has a fireplace, and front/side windows, and doesn\u2019t seem to interlink with any other room, so maybe we&#39;ll try for that.

We are adopting a baby ellie so will want to visit the Sheldrick centre for the 5pm to 6pm \u2018bedtime\u2019 while we are in Nairobi. We could do that the day after we leave Giraffe Manor, but logistically it would be more convenient to do it during our one day/night at GM. However, that would no doubt mean that we were away from GM from 4.40pm to 6.20pm or so. If that is a peak giraffe-cocktail time at GM, then presumably we\u2019d be silly to go off-site then? Or would there be plenty of time to enjoy the giraffes (and the cocktails) between getting back around 6.20pm and whenever dinner takes place?",

It would seem to me that based upon the price at the Manor it may not be worthwhile to spend one night if you are going to be away so much during the day.We visited the visitors center and spent about 2 hours there. There are a few tables and chairs under umbrellas and of course the giraffes to feed. IT was a wonderful experience and although we tried to get rooms at the Manor (they were booked) it worked out well that we did not stay there.
