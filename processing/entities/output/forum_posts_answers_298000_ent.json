I was thinking it may be nice to get out of the city and stay somewhere relaxed on the outskirts.Two questions:- is it actually better to stay in Nairobi and explore, rather than being on the outskirts?- does you have any recommendations or ideas. I&#39;m quite into nature my fianc\u00e9e is into avoiding spiders!Any ideas tips etc etc are very much appreciated.",

Of course the Museum is worth a visit too as are the National archives (sadly overlooked by a lot of visitors). There is also the Bomas and theRailway Museum.For lovers of Nature there are the Animal Orphanage and theSafari Walkall byNairobi National Park. youColud also visit the Karen Blixen House or visit The Sheldrick Centre and many other possibilities available in Nairobi",

            "body": "In answer to your questions1. Attractions are spread out across Nairobi. For example, places like theGiraffe Centre,Karen Blixen Museum, Elephant Orphanage, Animal Orphanage andNational Parkare all very close to Karen, on the outskirts. If you were to stay somewhere like, say,Macushla House, you would be located in Langata and therefore within 15-20 minutes&#39; driving time of all of the above, traffic permitting. Then, for the downtown attractions such as theNational Museumand others listed in the previous post, you could organise with your hotel / B&amp;B to hire a taxi plus driver for the day to take you into town and wait while you visit them. Alternatively, you could stay in a downtown hotel and do your sightseeing vice versa. Personally speaking, I&#39;d go for the outskirts option as it&#39;s cheaper and quieter and Nairobi, IMHO, is a pretty grotty city!2. For accommodation on the outskirts I would recommend:Macushla HouseNgong HouseGiraffe ManorPalacina Suites/ResidenceHTHFL410",

Also in this vicinity you have the national Museaum and the reptile place just about 200yards away. In the and near the city centre you have The Nationa Archives (put an afternoon aside for this - well at least a couple of hours)and theRailway Museumand this is before we start adding things likeNairobi National Park, Animal Orphanage,Safari Walk, Giraffe Sanctuary, Karen Blick House this list goes on and on.",

It is a land of amazing contrasts - from the Coast to the cooler heights. From lush farmland to desert. From well dressed, seemingly rich, people to the desperately poor and needy.You can cross the Equator at over 9000ft and feel cold up there!! You can swim in pools fed by hot springs.........I am a &quot;people person&quot; - most Kenyans are warm hearted and friendly. In your charity work, you are very likely to see needs which may make you a bit uncomfortable doing some touristy things!! If I were you, I&#39;d not make too many plans in advance, unless you want to book a safari. (In that case you can get much advice on this forum.)TIA (This Is Africa) and last minute decisions are the norm, unless it it booking a popular hotel or safari!",

We will be headed to Masai Mara the next morning. We had been told to eat at the Carnivore but I see reviews that indicate it is not as exotic as it used to be and is also overpriced.Aside from that, what tours or sights to see might you recommend for the afternoon? It had been suggested we see the slum (sorry, forget the name) that is one of the largest in Africa. Not that we want to be tourists here but we will be on our way home fromUgandafrom humanitarian work and might find this educational.Thoughts?",

Japanesse - Tokyo in Westlands.I had dinner at Carnivore on Tuesday, and it was not bad. The experience is still great, and the meat is good (tho no exotic meats).Remember that traffic can be heavy in nairobi, so if you arrive in the aftrenoon, the drive from the airport to the hotel could take up to 2 hours. It would not leave too much time for sight seeing. You could go to Karen and see theGiraffe Centre, Karen Blixen&#39;s House, and do a spot of shopping.",

The only reason i suggest this is because you mentioned your work inUganda. Kibera is not for the average &#39;tourist&#39;.Things are quite bad there and the mere size of the place is unbelievable. 1.5 million people living in a &#39;real&#39; slum. It is the largest in all of africa. There is a spot at a school called &#39;olympic&#39; where you can get a great view of Kibera.Despite the conditions the people, especially the kids, are great.If you can find someone a local that is trustworthy get them to take you through. If you can get them to drive you to an area Jamhuri and then it is a 10min walk to Kibera. If you stay on the outer rim and don&#39;t take valuable you will get a better feel than a drive through. Just don&#39;t go at night. During the day you shouldn&#39;t have any probelms as long as you use common sense. I used to walk to the orphange by myself.Gypsygirl8",

The kids will love this. Fee is $50 to adopt an ellee.Then head to dinner. Carnivore is fun. Tamarind, a bit fancier, but food is excellent. Mediterraneo (Italian) is excellent... there are a few of these around NBO. Nairobi has become a &quot;foodie&quot; city, so there are many cuisines you might find of interest.

(about 2-2.5/hrs drive time)OR- Sat morning, road trip to Ol Pejeta, private conservation - stay at Sweetwater&#39;s, Porini Camp or Ol Pejeta Bush Camp (if open in Nov); game drives, night game drives; Sunday, game or walking safaris; return to NBO by evening. (about 2-2.5/hrs drive time).--- Cost for either of these should include: guide/vehicle, park fees, room/tent, meals, game drives and all transfersHope this helps.",

It&#39;ll cost you c1200Ksh into town (30 mins) and c1500Ksh to Karen (40mins).

I&#39;d check with Zim Embassy if this inoc is needed which is rather expensive. Also, taxi to/from hotel.And, for a 7:20am flight you have to be at airport for check-in/security at minimum 2/hrs prior departure (it&#39;s an international flight).

It is a lovely business hotel on southwest side of city but situated so as 1/2 hour drive (allow 2 hours before check-in) to airport. I had lunch at outdoor restaurant and a nap. There are some street wares just outside of hotel grounds if you want any last minute gifts. Nairobi can be dangerous (traffic bad) so don&#39;t go out with any valuables or not at all. I learned that everything is negotiable so don&#39;t fall for any of the street scams or high price quotes. There are probably day room prices ($80US) that can be negotiated depending on business so check around. The Sarova Pan-Afrik is right behind the Fairview and has a nice pool area.

There might be drunk youth but the thing with carnivore is that there can be multiple events going on at the same time so you choose the one that suits you.Most hotels(4 star and 5 star) in Nairobi CBD will also be having dinners and bands but I doubt you will get any firework action there.From what you are looking for and the fact that you have a 13 year old son, I can suggestSafari Park Hotelas my first option. In the past years they have been having dinners, dancers, live bands, dances, fireworks and a lot of other activities. I am sure this year too will be the same. You can call the hotel and confirm.My second option can be Carnivore and third Village Market.",

This way you are sure you are going to be picked up as soon as the flight lands.The choice of hotel then may not necessarily be confined to the proximity of the Airport as you will be dropped to your hotel safely.Having said that there are several options of nearby Airport hotels among them is Panari hotel, Ole Senari relatively new, Hill park hotel, Mvuli Park and many more depending on your budget. At that time it hardly takes twenty min to the city center as its clear all the way hardly any traffic. Its usually twenty Usd one way to the city center in a private transfer cab.

            "body": "You don&#39;t say whether you are transiting or staying longer? There isn&#39;t an airport shuttle bus - some of the better hotels might offer their own transport which you would have to arrange beforehand. The best thing is to order a private cab to wait for you - the driver will meet you at the barriers just outside the customs check at arrivals.As the OPs have mentioned, traffic at that time of the night is negligible, however if you need to return to the airport the next day to catch a flight allow at least 2 hours to get there, especially in the late afternoon or on Fridays. Even if the normal traffic is okay, quite often something happens (like a police shoot out with gangsters, or the presidential calvalcade, or a political speech at the stadium - all of which have happened to me) which stops traffic for hours on end (which means the cab might have trouble even getting to pick you up, let alone deliver you to the airport).If you are staying for a while, choose a hotel near the city or at Westlands - Westlands is safer I reckon, and there are cafes and restaurants there and at the Sarit Centre so you aren&#39;t stuck at the hotel, plus shops and the Maasai markets (in tin sheds on the corner opposite Sarit Centre) to buy some gifts. (The touts at the markets can be quite pushy though, so maybe team up with someone else if possible.)Jacaranda Hotelis fine and doesn&#39;t charge like a wounded bull.Also check TripAdvisor for guesthouses etc - the Mennonite Guesthouse off Rhapta Road is about 40 mins walk from Westlands shops, for example, but don&#39;t walk at night or evening.Andrews Apartments(also a hotel - at the end of Rhapta Road near St Marys schools) is really nice with a quiet green outlook (ask for a room looking over St Marys parkland) and pool, but not sure of their pricing.Also, maybe make a deal with your cab driver to drive you around for your stay - public transport as we know it doesn&#39;t exist, and can be dangerous. I can recommend Francis from Westline Travel (+254 (0) 724 988 866), or Nellion cabs (+254 (0) 734 354 738), or JimCabs. One way trip from JKIA into town/Westlands will be 1500 shillings - this is the standard. Further out (say to Karen) would be more.",

    "body": "Greetings!I will be staying in Nairobi for about 2 months starting in late June. I will also be returning to Nairobi next year for at least 12 months. I am hoping to find an inexpensive room or apartment fairly near the National Museums ofKenyafor this summer and, potentially, for when I move back. I prefer to find a place in a non-ex-pat community or perhaps a homestay. Does anyone know of a good way of finding a place to rent or to share with a family/roommate/student? Are there good ways to get connected or to find postings for apartments from abroad or once I am in Nairobi?Thanks!",

            "body": "There is probably more scope for finding accommodation for the 12 month stay, when you are there for two months. The National Museums are located in the Parklands/Westlands area and the nearest mall, Sarit Centre has a noticeboard where accommodation adverts are posted. The local newspapers also carry ads for accommodation. For longer term property rentals, it is not uncommon for 3 - 6 months deposit to be asked for. Also repainting the accommodation at the end of the tenancy is often a clause in the agreement, which you arrange and fund.I found these, during a quick search:https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/2424954?s=5gsO\u2026capitalfm.co.ke/property/residential-proper\u2026expat-blog.com/en/\u2026flats-for-rent.htmlhttp://www.homestay.com/kenya/nairobiYou have not mentioned your budget, but accommodation in Westlands, particularly can be quite expensive. Cheaper accommodation can be found in other areas of the city, but there is the distance and travel to consider, plus your own personal safety.Edited: 11 June 2014, 10:18",

We noticed a night watchman near the entrance.Our room was clean and affordable, and although it was probably due for a bit of refurbishment, the bed was very comfortable.The club itself was not very busy, and the meals (dinner and breakfast) while unremarkable, were ample and delicious. Couldn&#39;t fault the service. A few tuskers in the garden after we arrived went down very well.For our departure, the chap at reception (I think his name was Felix??) rang through to Safarilink to get them to come and pick us up for our 8 am flight (to Lewa Downs).The main attraction for us was the proximity to Wilson, with a focus on an easy connection with Safarilink. Worked very well, and we are planning to stay there again when we return next year.Hope you enjoy your trip.",

Carnivore Restaurant is also a lot of fun but probably better if you have company.

Card payments are accepted in many retail outlets, but more remotely located outlets eg. curio shops will operate on a cash basis.Also, I would urge you to pay tips in Kenya Shillings. Kenyan&#39;s are too polite to turn down a tip made in US Dollars. However, the reality is that the member of staff might not be readily able to change the money and will also lose on the exchange, as well as possibly needing to pay for travel to a bank/forex.

The only best thing I know of in Kenya is the safari. So is it safe in terms of infections and other safety point of view?2) What are the activities that can be done in this short time? Is it just the safari that is the attraction?3) If Safari is the only attraction, which is the best area to look for the stay? And which is the recommended tour operator?4) I have a budget of around USD 650 for 2 days which does not include the ticket cost.

The evening visit from 5-6pm, for those that have adopted ellies, is a different experience and very enjoyable. You get to meet the keepers and see your adopted chubby.Kazuri beads is also great. The tour of the bead making area is very interesting and the ladies very proud of their work. Their finished products are very reasonable in cost here. If you buy the same type of items at lodging, they are way more expensive.Utmanduni Crafts is also in the Karen area and is a great place to have lunch and shop. There is no pressure on the shopping like other places you might encounter. You can browse and bring your items to a central checkout. Prices are slightly higher than booths along the road, but it is wonderful to not have to haggle. They have clean bathrooms and their food is good and very reasonable.Laurena",

As for the Carnivore. . . enormous, no longer does game meat (unless you count chewy crocodile, okay camel and tasty ostrich), but the roast meat does just keep coming, and everyone enjoys themselves.From what you&#39;re saying, if you have the choice, I would stay at the Fairview and try the Blue Nile one evening - they do a so-called &quot;mix dish&quot; where you get to try lots of different food, not just Ethiopian, though that is the main style. Habesha is another Ethiopian place nearby that gets great feedback.Hope that&#39;s a help.Richard",

We would use the car to get from airport to Karen mid-afternoon Friday, and after that maybe to go one place in the area to do some birding if time permits. Early morning to the Park (to be there when it opens) and then if we do not spend the full day in the park to go to one or more of the following:Karura Forest, Ngong Forest,Giraffe Centrenature trail, Arboretum. I am assuming the 1st 3 are easier options wrt traffic. Back to Karen and then early morning to JK airport to be there for 7am (Sunday).Your thoughts appreciated.",

            "body": "Yacht,I supposeBangkokis a fair comparison.If you are only going between Jomo and Karen, with a few trips for birds and NBO Park, I cannot see you encountering any major problems. The Park is off Langata Rd, which is what you will use to get to Keran from Jomo. At the moment there are some works going on there, so it is a little more depressing than usual, but no world shattering.Also, the Park is one of those on the \u2018Card system\u2019, you could actually stop and do all the paperwork the day before going in, thus making entry quicker on the morning you visit. Sometimes there can be a queue at the desk, and anything you can do to avoid it gives you more time actually in there! Ideally, you want to hit the Gate at 0630ish.I would also opt for Ngong over Karuru forest, nothing to do with the birds, I don\u2019t know enough, just that the latter is over by Muthaiga and you\u2019d have to battle through town!If you come out early, and are puckish, there is a reasonable place to eat just by the Gift Shop, then you can get back on the road to theGiraffe Centre, that has a small Caf\u00e9 too, but is really form emergency eats! You may also wish to consider the Elephant Orphange, also in the area, time dependant.For a good feed in the evening, I would head for theTalisman, excellent place about 2 mins from Karen Shops, get your hotel to book a table though, it can get a little busy and try to eat on the Patio, it makes for a nice evening.Do beware, particularly when heading into the road-works on Langata of Matatus, they don\u2019t take prisoners and will when the traffic merges attempt to push you off the road to make space for themselves. For a first time driver over there, I would say bow out gracefully and let them in, it is better than ending up in the ditch.Be lucky and enjoy!",

Also, we want to minimize our touring so we can relax and enjoy GM - any suggestions? We will go to Sheldrick Elephant orphanage in the evening to visit our adoptee - is it worthwhile to also go during the noon public viewing? We will also go to the Giraffe Center.

It is difficult to say exactly where they will be and when as they have the whole garden to explore throughout the day, but it is safe to say that you will see them before 8am up at the Manor and also around tea time when they like to come up again! I have arrived at the manor at various times of the day and there is almost always a giraffe in sight , be it by the Manor or just down the hill.Re: what to do, you can walk to the giraffe centre from the Manor so, as you say this is a must. I would suggest going to the private session only at the Daphne Sheldrick orphanage. This is far more personalised and you will be able to ask specific questions about your elephant as well as seeing some of the others. The afternoon session can have as many as 150 people there and, although interesting for those who are not able to have a private viewing, is not as special. I would suggest that, as your time is short that you only do the private session.Depending on what you are most interested in, whilst you are coming back from the Daphne Sheldrick orphanage I would highly recommend stopping in at Marula studios. This is where they recycle flipflops from the Kenyan coast (they are washed up onto the beach and turtles have been killed by trying to eat them so they are removed and brought to Nairobi). Here they are made into all sorts of wonderful things such as toys, jewellery, mats etc. You can look around the factory and then head into the shop to see the end products. Kazuri beads is great for souvenir shopping and Matt Bronze is great to visit / see the bronzes being made and buy something of quality. Karen Blixen is also nice to see if you are interested in her history, but again, depending on your time you may want to get back to the Manor. You really do not want to miss out on the tea on the lawn with giraffe! Once you are back at the Manor you can enjoy the rest of the day / evening there. What is great is that the Manor is close to all these places, so it really comes down to your own preference. Hope this helps and you have a wonderful time there!",

It&#39;s 28km from Nairobi International Airport and assuming you&#39;re out of the airport and moving in a vehicle by 7.30am (pretty good going if you are), you won&#39;t be at Giraffe Manor until 9 or 9.30am, except possibly on a Sunday. BUT, you won&#39;t be able to check-in until 10.45/11am for the reasons Sandi states - there&#39;s no waiting area, no lobby and they&#39;re checking guests *out* between 10 and 11. So, you&#39;ll be hanging around for a bit, possibly at the AFEW Giraffe Centre itself (to which as guests of GM you would have free access, though possibly only once you&#39;ve checked in\u2026), which is just across the lawn, on the edge of the manor grounds.The bigger question is: if you aren&#39;t already holding a room at Giraffe Manor, book one soon. It&#39;s often full.As for the question of how to fill the 24 hours: &quot;Karen Blixen museum, bomas, Matt Bronze, Kazuki beads, open air market - which one?&quot; Kazuri Beads is nice, but I wouldn&#39;t pass up the opportunity to visitNairobi National Parkproperly - it&#39;s a really impressive 60 square miles of wilderness, not some sanitised city park, and you have a very good chance of seeing lions, and even greater chance (amazingly) of seeing both black and white rhinos.Have a great stay in Nairobi - a greatly underrated city.Richard Trillo",

The recycled flipflop place sounded neat as well.Not sure what you are doing about getting around to these places but we have used the same driver several times and he does a wonderful job. Waits patiently at the airport for us to clear immigration and get visas and helps me plan our day and keeps us on a schedule. The traffic is horrible in Nairobi and you can be stuck for hours, that it why it is necessary to make sure your driver is familiar with the road situation.

There is also Uhuru park which has pedallos, rides etc. Most hotels have swimming pools too so you should be able to fill the time that you are there and most Kenyans do like children - well at least that&#39;s been my experience.",

Bottle water all the way, hats, sunscreen and short days and you will be fine. If you have not already, be sure to visit travel clinic and get antibiotic prescriptions filled ahead for all travellers and take with you for emergency. We were there for 35 days and used ours.Don&#39;t expect to be taking a stroller as it will be useless on the poor roads, sidewalks except maybe in downtown Nairobi. Back pack carrier for that age might be useful. But taxis and guide will get you wherever you need to go so you should not have to carry that much.And to compare, we also went to India for 60 days when youngest was at the around same age as yours.Kenyais much cleaner and safer than crowed India.",

Not all camps/lodges have these as they&#39;re not always necessary, but I sure would for a little one. And for certain be sure to give him/her their malaria meds daily. There are a few types, but Malarone does have a pediatric dosage for child under 40lbs. Discuss with doc meds and inocs that all might need as even most adults haven&#39;t been since childhood - Tetanus, HepA, Polio.Besides forgetting about a stroller, know that most safari vehicles have seat belts but NOT childseats, so you might want to seriously consider one as the roads in some areas aren&#39;t the best. The little one will also often need a nap midday, so having one is best.Also be aware that you can arrange for an anya ( nanny, reasonably priced ) if you wish your own time, as a quiet dinner. Remember though that those younger than 4/yrs rarely remember the experience... sure from photos within a year or two after the trip, but by 6-7/yrs, it&#39;ll be long forgotten.As you&#39;ll have own guide/driver you&#39;ll be able to set your own schedule.

Several doses of strong antibiotics, water with electrolytes and soda water and 24 hours later all was fine and forgotten.We loved India as my wife has family there. Travelled the southern third and then the golden triangle. India is great for travel with hiring drivers and cars for ten days at a time and with kids it was much cheaper than private safari in Africa. And with the lions and other animals, they will not be off in the distance, they will be right beside the vehicle.",

However, we were thinking of arriving in Nairobi a few days early and taking in some other experiences. Does anyone have any suggested itineraries or day trips nearby that would be different from the Safari sights we can expect on our formal Safari? This is a once in a lifetime event so our budget is fairly open. We are always interested in meeting and experiencing the people within a new culture. We are intrigued by history but not huge art or artifact museum fans. We are fairly active, like to be on the water and are curious foodies. We have reservations at the Karen Blixen Coffee Garden for the night before our safari we will extend that or could stay somewhere else if you suggest overnighting at a location outside of Nairobi.Any advice would be appreciated.

We also asked our driver to take us to a shopping center so we could buy some snacks and drinks. He also took us by the slums of Nairobi (Kibera). I wish we would have spent more time in the slums. The people there were so friendly and the living conditions were so much different than what we see in America.We also changed money at a bank at the &quot;mall.&quot; This bank had a much better exchange rate than we got at the hotel. Also, it is better to haveKenyashillings for the Elephant orphanage and the Giraffe center. No credit cards accepted and the rate for US money (which they do accept) is far, far worse than if you use their currency.we went to Karen Blixen&#39;s Coffee House for lunch too--such a nice place to eat!!!

Any comments about the practicality and suggestions about where to go?Also, we have been told that we will need to buy visas to do this. But we will have spent a night in Nairobi a week earlier on the way toMalawi. Surely the visas we have bought to do this would still be valid - or do we need to re-enter the country once we have left?Any help appreciated.",

A near by HOTEL would be Panari, about km from the airport.Carnivore restaurant and a few others are aboutkm in the city, it will depend on how much time you have and day of the week because of traffic.",

Similar to The Carnivore much farther into town (consider the traffic); prices similar, most say the food is actually better... all you can eat.If your bags are thru-checked fromMalawithru NBO and homebound, no need to worry. If you have to collect, then you&#39;ll have to pay at restaurant check-room for them to be secure.Take a taxi outside the terminal. Negotiate the price beforehand, which shouldn&#39;t be but maybe $10 if that much. On return to airport, hotel doorman can get you a taxi. Be sure to allow 2/hrs to re-check, Immigration and Security for homebound flight.",

On the other hand, I am considering spending that Saturday night in a Nairobi hotel and then catching a bus on Sunday.Any thoughts/suggestions/recommendations would be greatly appreciated... both about the bus or perhaps about a convenient hotel to stay at for the night in Nairobi if I choose to do that.Thanks!Sam",

If you have never been in Africa before (especiallyKenya), it would be nice for you to travel during the day so you have your bearings. People unfamiliar with their surroundings (it seems) are more commonly victims of crime/petty theft. Not to scare you, but I&#39;ve heard so many stories (and never been a crime victim myself because I&#39;m overly-cautious) so I think you should heed my advise. You would be best-served to take a bus or shuttle the next morning and grab a hotel on Sunday. You will route through Arusha and then onward to Moshi. The Impala shuttle is comfortablehttp://www.impalashuttle.com/and will get you to Moshi. Riverside shuttle is another option, but there have been a few bad reviews on this forum latelyhttp://www.riverside-shuttle.com/.I can&#39;t speak for Scandinavian, as the quality of buses change from year to year or month to month. It used to look decent (haven&#39;t ever taken them myself) but that can change quickly. I like the shuttles, and they are pretty comfortable compared to the buses. Again a bus in Kenya cannot be compared to a bus in the US.Good luck.",

And, if the day you are planning this is a Sunday, very little traffic in the morning, though more later in the day.There&#39;s also a nice cafe at Utamaduni Crafts (near Kazuri Beads) at more reasonable prices than Karen Blixen Coffee/Tamambo,(but then lots of cuisine choices in NBO, so whatever you might wish). And, do stop in at Utamaduni to shop.Edited: 11 July 2012, 03:03",

They do not do factory tours (which was extremely interesting to me) on Sundays.If this day is following a safari, IMHO, skipping the giraffe center would be an option. You will have seen giraffes already and they will be truly in the wild. A lot of people seem to like the giraffe center because you can touch the giraffe or &#39;get a kiss&#39; from one. But to me, it was more like going to a zoo and it can be quite crowded.Seeing the elephants at the orphanage twice is great (provided as Sandi said you have adopted one) because what they do at the two times is different. I really enjoyed Kazuri and the Karen Blixen estate.",

I only have handluggage, so no waiting for checked luggage.I&#39;d really like to avoid sitting at the airport all that time.How reasonable is it, considering prices, logistics and trafficjams, to visit theNairobi National Park?What can I expect to pay, and what are my options? Is it feasble given the time I have? Should i use an organised safari company or a local taxi?Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I&#39;m from RSA so well familiar with game reserves, the prime viewing times (notusually midday) etc etc..so don&#39;t need advice on that. This is more a question on logistics,costs and option - anything would be GREATLY appreciated!Cheers",

Nairobi Natl Prk,Karen Blixen Museum, Giraffe Center, 11am visit Sheldrick Elephant Orphanage (finished by 12N), time for quick lunch. Each site has a small entry free from a few hundredKenyashillings to, I believe, $40 for theNational Park.Leaving the airport during rush hour it can take you a short 45/min (unlikely) or long 2/hrs to get to your first stop for opening, i.e., Nairobi NP.Deplaning, you have to purchase a Transit Visa $20, suggest you withdraw from ATM some local currency to cover your fees, then go out and find a taxi (negotiate the fare for 4/hrs) for driver to take you to these sites, wait for you and return you to airport by 2pm.I&#39;m sure others will have additional input.

The entrance fee to the park is 40$ and the ride to the park and back to the airport will be about 100$.There are no other charges..you can easily beat traffic in the morning by using shorter routes that avoid the city centre direction. the journey back should be smooth as there is no traffic at around 1-2pm headed to the airport.Am sure you can make it.

We came across at least 10 dead buffalo and 1 dead rhino they were moving with bulldozers :( There are not many flamingos there anymore either because the lake is flooded and it&#39;s hard for them to wade in the marshes that were once there.

I was thinking it may be nice to get out of the city and stay somewhere relaxed on the outskirts.Two questions:- is it actually better to stay in Nairobi and explore, rather than being on the outskirts?- does you have any recommendations or ideas. I&#39;m quite into nature my fianc\u00e9e is into avoiding spiders!Any ideas tips etc etc are very much appreciated.",

Of course the Museum is worth a visit too as are the National archives (sadly overlooked by a lot of visitors). There is also the Bomas and theRailway Museum.For lovers of Nature there are the Animal Orphanage and theSafari Walkall byNairobi National Park. youColud also visit the Karen Blixen House or visit The Sheldrick Centre and many other possibilities available in Nairobi",

For example, places like theGiraffe Centre,Karen Blixen Museum, Elephant Orphanage, Animal Orphanage andNational Parkare all very close to Karen, on the outskirts. If you were to stay somewhere like, say,Macushla House, you would be located in Langata and therefore within 15-20 minutes&#39; driving time of all of the above, traffic permitting. Then, for the downtown attractions such as theNational Museumand others listed in the previous post, you could organise with your hotel / B&amp;B to hire a taxi plus driver for the day to take you into town and wait while you visit them. Alternatively, you could stay in a downtown hotel and do your sightseeing vice versa. Personally speaking, I&#39;d go for the outskirts option as it&#39;s cheaper and quieter and Nairobi, IMHO, is a pretty grotty city!2. For accommodation on the outskirts I would recommend:Macushla HouseNgong HouseGiraffe ManorPalacina Suites/ResidenceHTHFL410",

From well dressed, seemingly rich, people to the desperately poor and needy.You can cross the Equator at over 9000ft and feel cold up there!! You can swim in pools fed by hot springs.........I am a &quot;people person&quot; - most Kenyans are warm hearted and friendly. In your charity work, you are very likely to see needs which may make you a bit uncomfortable doing some touristy things!! If I were you, I&#39;d not make too many plans in advance, unless you want to book a safari. (In that case you can get much advice on this forum.)TIA (This Is Africa) and last minute decisions are the norm, unless it it booking a popular hotel or safari!",

We will be headed to Masai Mara the next morning.

It had been suggested we see the slum (sorry, forget the name) that is one of the largest in Africa. Not that we want to be tourists here but we will be on our way home fromUgandafrom humanitarian work and might find this educational.Thoughts?",

Japanesse - Tokyo in Westlands.I had dinner at Carnivore on Tuesday, and it was not bad. The experience is still great, and the meat is good (tho no exotic meats).Remember that traffic can be heavy in nairobi, so if you arrive in the aftrenoon, the drive from the airport to the hotel could take up to 2 hours. It would not leave too much time for sight seeing. You could go to Karen and see theGiraffe Centre, Karen Blixen&#39;s House, and do a spot of shopping.",

The only reason i suggest this is because you mentioned your work inUganda. Kibera is not for the average &#39;tourist&#39;.Things are quite bad there and the mere size of the place is unbelievable. 1.5 million people living in a &#39;real&#39; slum. It is the largest in all of africa. There is a spot at a school called &#39;olympic&#39; where you can get a great view of Kibera.Despite the conditions the people, especially the kids, are great.If you can find someone a local that is trustworthy get them to take you through. If you can get them to drive you to an area Jamhuri and then it is a 10min walk to Kibera. If you stay on the outer rim and don&#39;t take valuable you will get a better feel than a drive through. Just don&#39;t go at night. During the day you shouldn&#39;t have any probelms as long as you use common sense. I used to walk to the orphange by myself.Gypsygirl8",

The kids will love this. Fee is $50 to adopt an ellee.Then head to dinner. Carnivore is fun. Tamarind, a bit fancier, but food is excellent. Mediterraneo (Italian) is excellent... there are a few of these around NBO. Nairobi has become a &quot;foodie&quot; city, so there are many cuisines you might find of interest.

(about 2-2.5/hrs drive time)OR- Sat morning, road trip to Ol Pejeta, private conservation - stay at Sweetwater&#39;s, Porini Camp or Ol Pejeta Bush Camp (if open in Nov); game drives, night game drives; Sunday, game or walking safaris; return to NBO by evening. (about 2-2.5/hrs drive time).--- Cost for either of these should include: guide/vehicle, park fees, room/tent, meals, game drives and all transfersHope this helps.",

I&#39;d check with Zim Embassy if this inoc is needed which is rather expensive. Also, taxi to/from hotel.And, for a 7:20am flight you have to be at airport for check-in/security at minimum 2/hrs prior departure (it&#39;s an international flight).

It is a lovely business hotel on southwest side of city but situated so as 1/2 hour drive (allow 2 hours before check-in) to airport. I had lunch at outdoor restaurant and a nap. There are some street wares just outside of hotel grounds if you want any last minute gifts. Nairobi can be dangerous (traffic bad) so don&#39;t go out with any valuables or not at all. I learned that everything is negotiable so don&#39;t fall for any of the street scams or high price quotes.

There might be drunk youth but the thing with carnivore is that there can be multiple events going on at the same time so you choose the one that suits you.Most hotels(4 star and 5 star) in Nairobi CBD will also be having dinners and bands but I doubt you will get any firework action there.From what you are looking for and the fact that you have a 13 year old son, I can suggestSafari Park Hotelas my first option. In the past years they have been having dinners, dancers, live bands, dances, fireworks and a lot of other activities. I am sure this year too will be the same. You can call the hotel and confirm.My second option can be Carnivore and third Village Market.",

This way you are sure you are going to be picked up as soon as the flight lands.The choice of hotel then may not necessarily be confined to the proximity of the Airport as you will be dropped to your hotel safely.Having said that there are several options of nearby Airport hotels among them is Panari hotel, Ole Senari relatively new, Hill park hotel, Mvuli Park and many more depending on your budget. At that time it hardly takes twenty min to the city center as its clear all the way hardly any traffic. Its usually twenty Usd one way to the city center in a private transfer cab.

            "body": "You don&#39;t say whether you are transiting or staying longer? There isn&#39;t an airport shuttle bus - some of the better hotels might offer their own transport which you would have to arrange beforehand. The best thing is to order a private cab to wait for you - the driver will meet you at the barriers just outside the customs check at arrivals.As the OPs have mentioned, traffic at that time of the night is negligible, however if you need to return to the airport the next day to catch a flight allow at least 2 hours to get there, especially in the late afternoon or on Fridays. Even if the normal traffic is okay, quite often something happens (like a police shoot out with gangsters, or the presidential calvalcade, or a political speech at the stadium - all of which have happened to me) which stops traffic for hours on end (which means the cab might have trouble even getting to pick you up, let alone deliver you to the airport).If you are staying for a while, choose a hotel near the city or at Westlands - Westlands is safer I reckon, and there are cafes and restaurants there and at the Sarit Centre so you aren&#39;t stuck at the hotel, plus shops and the Maasai markets (in tin sheds on the corner opposite Sarit Centre) to buy some gifts. (The touts at the markets can be quite pushy though, so maybe team up with someone else if possible.)Jacaranda Hotelis fine and doesn&#39;t charge like a wounded bull.Also check TripAdvisor for guesthouses etc - the Mennonite Guesthouse off Rhapta Road is about 40 mins walk from Westlands shops, for example, but don&#39;t walk at night or evening.Andrews Apartments(also a hotel - at the end of Rhapta Road near St Marys schools) is really nice with a quiet green outlook (ask for a room looking over St Marys parkland) and pool, but not sure of their pricing.Also, maybe make a deal with your cab driver to drive you around for your stay - public transport as we know it doesn&#39;t exist, and can be dangerous. I can recommend Francis from Westline Travel (+254 (0) 724 988 866), or Nellion cabs (+254 (0) 734 354 738), or JimCabs. One way trip from JKIA into town/Westlands will be 1500 shillings - this is the standard. Further out (say to Karen) would be more.",

    "body": "Greetings!I will be staying in Nairobi for about 2 months starting in late June. I will also be returning to Nairobi next year for at least 12 months. I am hoping to find an inexpensive room or apartment fairly near the National Museums ofKenyafor this summer and, potentially, for when I move back. I prefer to find a place in a non-ex-pat community or perhaps a homestay. Does anyone know of a good way of finding a place to rent or to share with a family/roommate/student? Are there good ways to get connected or to find postings for apartments from abroad or once I am in Nairobi?Thanks!",

            "body": "There is probably more scope for finding accommodation for the 12 month stay, when you are there for two months. The National Museums are located in the Parklands/Westlands area and the nearest mall, Sarit Centre has a noticeboard where accommodation adverts are posted. The local newspapers also carry ads for accommodation. For longer term property rentals, it is not uncommon for 3 - 6 months deposit to be asked for. Also repainting the accommodation at the end of the tenancy is often a clause in the agreement, which you arrange and fund.I found these, during a quick search:https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/2424954?s=5gsO\u2026capitalfm.co.ke/property/residential-proper\u2026expat-blog.com/en/\u2026flats-for-rent.htmlhttp://www.homestay.com/kenya/nairobiYou have not mentioned your budget, but accommodation in Westlands, particularly can be quite expensive. Cheaper accommodation can be found in other areas of the city, but there is the distance and travel to consider, plus your own personal safety.Edited: 11 June 2014, 10:18",

Couldn&#39;t fault the service. A few tuskers in the garden after we arrived went down very well.For our departure, the chap at reception (I think his name was Felix??) rang through to Safarilink to get them to come and pick us up for our 8 am flight (to Lewa Downs).The main attraction for us was the proximity to Wilson, with a focus on an easy connection with Safarilink. Worked very well, and we are planning to stay there again when we return next year.Hope you enjoy your trip.",

You can also tour Maasai mara , Lake Nakuru or Naivasha , if you have time to do them all. Lake Naivasha is good for walking safari , Lake Nakuru or Naivasha can be done on day trips , Maasai mara is a minimum of 3 days on road safari.Good luck.",

Other highlights are theGiraffe Centrewhere you can feed the giraffes and learn more about them,Karen Blixen Museum(Out of Africa), Bomas of Africa, a cultural village where you will learn about the tribes and watch them perform,Utamaduni Craft Centrefor more up-market crafts. Carnivore Restaurant is also a lot of fun but probably better if you have company. All of these attractions are in Langata an outer suburb of Nairobi, so all close by to each other.I have friends in the safari business in Nairobi who I would recommend to you, but not sure how their cost would compare to other forms of travel for a single person.

Card payments are accepted in many retail outlets, but more remotely located outlets eg. curio shops will operate on a cash basis.Also, I would urge you to pay tips in Kenya Shillings. Kenyan&#39;s are too polite to turn down a tip made in US Dollars. However, the reality is that the member of staff might not be readily able to change the money and will also lose on the exchange, as well as possibly needing to pay for travel to a bank/forex.

And which is the recommended tour operator?4) I have a budget of around USD 650 for 2 days which does not include the ticket cost.

Game drives were excellent.cheersAndrew",

The evening visit from 5-6pm, for those that have adopted ellies, is a different experience and very enjoyable. You get to meet the keepers and see your adopted chubby.Kazuri beads is also great. The tour of the bead making area is very interesting and the ladies very proud of their work. Their finished products are very reasonable in cost here. If you buy the same type of items at lodging, they are way more expensive.Utmanduni Crafts is also in the Karen area and is a great place to have lunch and shop. There is no pressure on the shopping like other places you might encounter. You can browse and bring your items to a central checkout. Prices are slightly higher than booths along the road, but it is wonderful to not have to haggle. They have clean bathrooms and their food is good and very reasonable.Laurena",

As for the Carnivore. . . enormous, no longer does game meat (unless you count chewy crocodile, okay camel and tasty ostrich), but the roast meat does just keep coming, and everyone enjoys themselves.From what you&#39;re saying, if you have the choice, I would stay at the Fairview and try the Blue Nile one evening - they do a so-called &quot;mix dish&quot; where you get to try lots of different food, not just Ethiopian, though that is the main style. Habesha is another Ethiopian place nearby that gets great feedback.Hope that&#39;s a help.Richard",

We would use the car to get from airport to Karen mid-afternoon Friday, and after that maybe to go one place in the area to do some birding if time permits. Early morning to the Park (to be there when it opens) and then if we do not spend the full day in the park to go to one or more of the following:Karura Forest, Ngong Forest,Giraffe Centrenature trail, Arboretum. I am assuming the 1st 3 are easier options wrt traffic. Back to Karen and then early morning to JK airport to be there for 7am (Sunday).Your thoughts appreciated.",

            "body": "Yacht,I supposeBangkokis a fair comparison.If you are only going between Jomo and Karen, with a few trips for birds and NBO Park, I cannot see you encountering any major problems. The Park is off Langata Rd, which is what you will use to get to Keran from Jomo. At the moment there are some works going on there, so it is a little more depressing than usual, but no world shattering.Also, the Park is one of those on the \u2018Card system\u2019, you could actually stop and do all the paperwork the day before going in, thus making entry quicker on the morning you visit. Sometimes there can be a queue at the desk, and anything you can do to avoid it gives you more time actually in there! Ideally, you want to hit the Gate at 0630ish.I would also opt for Ngong over Karuru forest, nothing to do with the birds, I don\u2019t know enough, just that the latter is over by Muthaiga and you\u2019d have to battle through town!If you come out early, and are puckish, there is a reasonable place to eat just by the Gift Shop, then you can get back on the road to theGiraffe Centre, that has a small Caf\u00e9 too, but is really form emergency eats! You may also wish to consider the Elephant Orphange, also in the area, time dependant.For a good feed in the evening, I would head for theTalisman, excellent place about 2 mins from Karen Shops, get your hotel to book a table though, it can get a little busy and try to eat on the Patio, it makes for a nice evening.Do beware, particularly when heading into the road-works on Langata of Matatus, they don\u2019t take prisoners and will when the traffic merges attempt to push you off the road to make space for themselves. For a first time driver over there, I would say bow out gracefully and let them in, it is better than ending up in the ditch.Be lucky and enjoy!",

Also, we want to minimize our touring so we can relax and enjoy GM - any suggestions? We will go to Sheldrick Elephant orphanage in the evening to visit our adoptee - is it worthwhile to also go during the noon public viewing? We will also go to the Giraffe Center.

It is difficult to say exactly where they will be and when as they have the whole garden to explore throughout the day, but it is safe to say that you will see them before 8am up at the Manor and also around tea time when they like to come up again! I have arrived at the manor at various times of the day and there is almost always a giraffe in sight , be it by the Manor or just down the hill.Re: what to do, you can walk to the giraffe centre from the Manor so, as you say this is a must. I would suggest going to the private session only at the Daphne Sheldrick orphanage. This is far more personalised and you will be able to ask specific questions about your elephant as well as seeing some of the others. The afternoon session can have as many as 150 people there and, although interesting for those who are not able to have a private viewing, is not as special. I would suggest that, as your time is short that you only do the private session.Depending on what you are most interested in, whilst you are coming back from the Daphne Sheldrick orphanage I would highly recommend stopping in at Marula studios. This is where they recycle flipflops from the Kenyan coast (they are washed up onto the beach and turtles have been killed by trying to eat them so they are removed and brought to Nairobi). Here they are made into all sorts of wonderful things such as toys, jewellery, mats etc. You can look around the factory and then head into the shop to see the end products. Kazuri beads is great for souvenir shopping and Matt Bronze is great to visit / see the bronzes being made and buy something of quality. Karen Blixen is also nice to see if you are interested in her history, but again, depending on your time you may want to get back to the Manor. You really do not want to miss out on the tea on the lawn with giraffe! Once you are back at the Manor you can enjoy the rest of the day / evening there. What is great is that the Manor is close to all these places, so it really comes down to your own preference. Hope this helps and you have a wonderful time there!",

It&#39;s 28km from Nairobi International Airport and assuming you&#39;re out of the airport and moving in a vehicle by 7.30am (pretty good going if you are), you won&#39;t be at Giraffe Manor until 9 or 9.30am, except possibly on a Sunday. BUT, you won&#39;t be able to check-in until 10.45/11am for the reasons Sandi states - there&#39;s no waiting area, no lobby and they&#39;re checking guests *out* between 10 and 11. So, you&#39;ll be hanging around for a bit, possibly at the AFEW Giraffe Centre itself (to which as guests of GM you would have free access, though possibly only once you&#39;ve checked in\u2026), which is just across the lawn, on the edge of the manor grounds.The bigger question is: if you aren&#39;t already holding a room at Giraffe Manor, book one soon. It&#39;s often full.As for the question of how to fill the 24 hours: &quot;Karen Blixen museum, bomas, Matt Bronze, Kazuki beads, open air market - which one?&quot; Kazuri Beads is nice, but I wouldn&#39;t pass up the opportunity to visitNairobi National Parkproperly - it&#39;s a really impressive 60 square miles of wilderness, not some sanitised city park, and you have a very good chance of seeing lions, and even greater chance (amazingly) of seeing both black and white rhinos.Have a great stay in Nairobi - a greatly underrated city.Richard Trillo",

The recycled flipflop place sounded neat as well.Not sure what you are doing about getting around to these places but we have used the same driver several times and he does a wonderful job. Waits patiently at the airport for us to clear immigration and get visas and helps me plan our day and keeps us on a schedule. The traffic is horrible in Nairobi and you can be stuck for hours, that it why it is necessary to make sure your driver is familiar with the road situation.

There is also Uhuru park which has pedallos, rides etc. Most hotels have swimming pools too so you should be able to fill the time that you are there and most Kenyans do like children - well at least that&#39;s been my experience.",

Bottle water all the way, hats, sunscreen and short days and you will be fine. If you have not already, be sure to visit travel clinic and get antibiotic prescriptions filled ahead for all travellers and take with you for emergency. We were there for 35 days and used ours.Don&#39;t expect to be taking a stroller as it will be useless on the poor roads, sidewalks except maybe in downtown Nairobi. Back pack carrier for that age might be useful. But taxis and guide will get you wherever you need to go so you should not have to carry that much.And to compare, we also went to India for 60 days when youngest was at the around same age as yours.Kenyais much cleaner and safer than crowed India.",

Not all camps/lodges have these as they&#39;re not always necessary, but I sure would for a little one. And for certain be sure to give him/her their malaria meds daily. There are a few types, but Malarone does have a pediatric dosage for child under 40lbs. Discuss with doc meds and inocs that all might need as even most adults haven&#39;t been since childhood - Tetanus, HepA, Polio.Besides forgetting about a stroller, know that most safari vehicles have seat belts but NOT childseats, so you might want to seriously consider one as the roads in some areas aren&#39;t the best. The little one will also often need a nap midday, so having one is best.Also be aware that you can arrange for an anya ( nanny, reasonably priced ) if you wish your own time, as a quiet dinner. Remember though that those younger than 4/yrs rarely remember the experience... sure from photos within a year or two after the trip, but by 6-7/yrs, it&#39;ll be long forgotten.As you&#39;ll have own guide/driver you&#39;ll be able to set your own schedule. While there are pools, whether at NBO hotels or when out on safari, few if any are heated, so keep that in mind.",

We all had it at the same time during one night while on safari and staying in a small cabin so likely spoiled food from a roadside stop on the way there. That was a night to remember for sure with only one bathroom between four of us. Several doses of strong antibiotics, water with electrolytes and soda water and 24 hours later all was fine and forgotten.We loved India as my wife has family there. Travelled the southern third and then the golden triangle. India is great for travel with hiring drivers and cars for ten days at a time and with kids it was much cheaper than private safari in Africa.

However, we were thinking of arriving in Nairobi a few days early and taking in some other experiences. Does anyone have any suggested itineraries or day trips nearby that would be different from the Safari sights we can expect on our formal Safari? This is a once in a lifetime event so our budget is fairly open. We are always interested in meeting and experiencing the people within a new culture. We are intrigued by history but not huge art or artifact museum fans. We are fairly active, like to be on the water and are curious foodies. We have reservations at the Karen Blixen Coffee Garden for the night before our safari we will extend that or could stay somewhere else if you suggest overnighting at a location outside of Nairobi.Any advice would be appreciated.

We also asked our driver to take us to a shopping center so we could buy some snacks and drinks. He also took us by the slums of Nairobi (Kibera). I wish we would have spent more time in the slums. The people there were so friendly and the living conditions were so much different than what we see in America.We also changed money at a bank at the &quot;mall.&quot; This bank had a much better exchange rate than we got at the hotel. Also, it is better to haveKenyashillings for the Elephant orphanage and the Giraffe center. No credit cards accepted and the rate for US money (which they do accept) is far, far worse than if you use their currency.we went to Karen Blixen&#39;s Coffee House for lunch too--such a nice place to eat!!!

    "body": "Hi - we are going to be at Nairobi airport for a very long time when we transit it in August waiting for our international connection. Not good - as we have two kids!Our travel company quoted for a driver to take us out for dinner - but their quote is very expensive. We wondered about getting a taxi to one of the nearby hotels and having a meal there to kill some time. Any comments about the practicality and suggestions about where to go?Also, we have been told that we will need to buy visas to do this. But we will have spent a night in Nairobi a week earlier on the way toMalawi. Surely the visas we have bought to do this would still be valid - or do we need to re-enter the country once we have left?Any help appreciated.",

Similar to The Carnivore much farther into town (consider the traffic); prices similar, most say the food is actually better... all you can eat.If your bags are thru-checked fromMalawithru NBO and homebound, no need to worry. If you have to collect, then you&#39;ll have to pay at restaurant check-room for them to be secure.Take a taxi outside the terminal. Negotiate the price beforehand, which shouldn&#39;t be but maybe $10 if that much. On return to airport, hotel doorman can get you a taxi. Be sure to allow 2/hrs to re-check, Immigration and Security for homebound flight.",

On the other hand, I am considering spending that Saturday night in a Nairobi hotel and then catching a bus on Sunday.Any thoughts/suggestions/recommendations would be greatly appreciated... both about the bus or perhaps about a convenient hotel to stay at for the night in Nairobi if I choose to do that.Thanks!Sam",

If you have never been in Africa before (especiallyKenya), it would be nice for you to travel during the day so you have your bearings. People unfamiliar with their surroundings (it seems) are more commonly victims of crime/petty theft. Not to scare you, but I&#39;ve heard so many stories (and never been a crime victim myself because I&#39;m overly-cautious) so I think you should heed my advise. You would be best-served to take a bus or shuttle the next morning and grab a hotel on Sunday. You will route through Arusha and then onward to Moshi. The Impala shuttle is comfortablehttp://www.impalashuttle.com/and will get you to Moshi. Riverside shuttle is another option, but there have been a few bad reviews on this forum latelyhttp://www.riverside-shuttle.com/.I can&#39;t speak for Scandinavian, as the quality of buses change from year to year or month to month. It used to look decent (haven&#39;t ever taken them myself) but that can change quickly. I like the shuttles, and they are pretty comfortable compared to the buses. Again a bus in Kenya cannot be compared to a bus in the US.Good luck.",

Then back to the Fairview, so traffic shouldn&#39;t be all that much of a factor. And, if the day you are planning this is a Sunday, very little traffic in the morning, though more later in the day.There&#39;s also a nice cafe at Utamaduni Crafts (near Kazuri Beads) at more reasonable prices than Karen Blixen Coffee/Tamambo,(but then lots of cuisine choices in NBO, so whatever you might wish).

They do not do factory tours (which was extremely interesting to me) on Sundays.If this day is following a safari, IMHO, skipping the giraffe center would be an option. You will have seen giraffes already and they will be truly in the wild. A lot of people seem to like the giraffe center because you can touch the giraffe or &#39;get a kiss&#39; from one. But to me, it was more like going to a zoo and it can be quite crowded.Seeing the elephants at the orphanage twice is great (provided as Sandi said you have adopted one) because what they do at the two times is different. I really enjoyed Kazuri and the Karen Blixen estate.",

I only have handluggage, so no waiting for checked luggage.I&#39;d really like to avoid sitting at the airport all that time.How reasonable is it, considering prices, logistics and trafficjams, to visit theNairobi National Park?What can I expect to pay, and what are my options? Is it feasble given the time I have? Should i use an organised safari company or a local taxi?Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I&#39;m from RSA so well familiar with game reserves, the prime viewing times (notusually midday) etc etc..so don&#39;t need advice on that. This is more a question on logistics,costs and option - anything would be GREATLY appreciated!Cheers",

Each site has a small entry free from a few hundredKenyashillings to, I believe, $40 for theNational Park.Leaving the airport during rush hour it can take you a short 45/min (unlikely) or long 2/hrs to get to your first stop for opening, i.e., Nairobi NP.Deplaning, you have to purchase a Transit Visa $20, suggest you withdraw from ATM some local currency to cover your fees, then go out and find a taxi (negotiate the fare for 4/hrs) for driver to take you to these sites, wait for you and return you to airport by 2pm.I&#39;m sure others will have additional input.

The entrance fee to the park is 40$ and the ride to the park and back to the airport will be about 100$.There are no other charges..you can easily beat traffic in the morning by using shorter routes that avoid the city centre direction. the journey back should be smooth as there is no traffic at around 1-2pm headed to the airport.Am sure you can make it.

We came across at least 10 dead buffalo and 1 dead rhino they were moving with bulldozers :( There are not many flamingos there anymore either because the lake is flooded and it&#39;s hard for them to wade in the marshes that were once there. However, the scenery was very green and beautiful.Check out Odyssey Safaris and request Erastus (he is awesome and waited 2 hours for us at the airport!) - they should be able to do a trip tailored to what you request.http://www.odysseysafaris.comEdited: 20 July 2015, 12:42",

I was thinking it may be nice to get out of the city and stay somewhere relaxed on the outskirts.Two questions:- is it actually better to stay in Nairobi and explore, rather than being on the outskirts?- does you have any recommendations or ideas. I&#39;m quite into nature my fianc\u00e9e is into avoiding spiders!Any ideas tips etc etc are very much appreciated.",

Of course the Museum is worth a visit too as are the National archives (sadly overlooked by a lot of visitors). There is also the Bomas and theRailway Museum.For lovers of Nature there are the Animal Orphanage and theSafari Walkall byNairobi National Park. youColud also visit the Karen Blixen House or visit The Sheldrick Centre and many other possibilities available in Nairobi",

For example, places like theGiraffe Centre,Karen Blixen Museum, Elephant Orphanage, Animal Orphanage andNational Parkare all very close to Karen, on the outskirts. If you were to stay somewhere like, say,Macushla House, you would be located in Langata and therefore within 15-20 minutes&#39; driving time of all of the above, traffic permitting. Then, for the downtown attractions such as theNational Museumand others listed in the previous post, you could organise with your hotel / B&amp;B to hire a taxi plus driver for the day to take you into town and wait while you visit them. Alternatively, you could stay in a downtown hotel and do your sightseeing vice versa. Personally speaking, I&#39;d go for the outskirts option as it&#39;s cheaper and quieter and Nairobi, IMHO, is a pretty grotty city!2. For accommodation on the outskirts I would recommend:Macushla HouseNgong HouseGiraffe ManorPalacina Suites/ResidenceHTHFL410",

From well dressed, seemingly rich, people to the desperately poor and needy.You can cross the Equator at over 9000ft and feel cold up there!! You can swim in pools fed by hot springs.........I am a &quot;people person&quot; - most Kenyans are warm hearted and friendly. In your charity work, you are very likely to see needs which may make you a bit uncomfortable doing some touristy things!! If I were you, I&#39;d not make too many plans in advance, unless you want to book a safari. (In that case you can get much advice on this forum.)TIA (This Is Africa) and last minute decisions are the norm, unless it it booking a popular hotel or safari!",

We will be headed to Masai Mara the next morning.

It had been suggested we see the slum (sorry, forget the name) that is one of the largest in Africa. Not that we want to be tourists here but we will be on our way home fromUgandafrom humanitarian work and might find this educational.Thoughts?",

Japanesse - Tokyo in Westlands.I had dinner at Carnivore on Tuesday, and it was not bad. The experience is still great, and the meat is good (tho no exotic meats).Remember that traffic can be heavy in nairobi, so if you arrive in the aftrenoon, the drive from the airport to the hotel could take up to 2 hours. It would not leave too much time for sight seeing. You could go to Karen and see theGiraffe Centre, Karen Blixen&#39;s House, and do a spot of shopping.",

The only reason i suggest this is because you mentioned your work inUganda. Kibera is not for the average &#39;tourist&#39;.Things are quite bad there and the mere size of the place is unbelievable. 1.5 million people living in a &#39;real&#39; slum. It is the largest in all of africa. There is a spot at a school called &#39;olympic&#39; where you can get a great view of Kibera.Despite the conditions the people, especially the kids, are great.If you can find someone a local that is trustworthy get them to take you through. If you can get them to drive you to an area Jamhuri and then it is a 10min walk to Kibera. If you stay on the outer rim and don&#39;t take valuable you will get a better feel than a drive through. Just don&#39;t go at night. During the day you shouldn&#39;t have any probelms as long as you use common sense. I used to walk to the orphange by myself.Gypsygirl8",

The kids will love this. Fee is $50 to adopt an ellee.Then head to dinner. Carnivore is fun. Tamarind, a bit fancier, but food is excellent. Mediterraneo (Italian) is excellent... there are a few of these around NBO. Nairobi has become a &quot;foodie&quot; city, so there are many cuisines you might find of interest.

(about 2-2.5/hrs drive time)OR- Sat morning, road trip to Ol Pejeta, private conservation - stay at Sweetwater&#39;s, Porini Camp or Ol Pejeta Bush Camp (if open in Nov); game drives, night game drives; Sunday, game or walking safaris; return to NBO by evening. (about 2-2.5/hrs drive time).--- Cost for either of these should include: guide/vehicle, park fees, room/tent, meals, game drives and all transfersHope this helps.",

I&#39;d check with Zim Embassy if this inoc is needed which is rather expensive. Also, taxi to/from hotel.And, for a 7:20am flight you have to be at airport for check-in/security at minimum 2/hrs prior departure (it&#39;s an international flight).

It is a lovely business hotel on southwest side of city but situated so as 1/2 hour drive (allow 2 hours before check-in) to airport. I had lunch at outdoor restaurant and a nap. There are some street wares just outside of hotel grounds if you want any last minute gifts. Nairobi can be dangerous (traffic bad) so don&#39;t go out with any valuables or not at all. I learned that everything is negotiable so don&#39;t fall for any of the street scams or high price quotes.

There might be drunk youth but the thing with carnivore is that there can be multiple events going on at the same time so you choose the one that suits you.Most hotels(4 star and 5 star) in Nairobi CBD will also be having dinners and bands but I doubt you will get any firework action there.From what you are looking for and the fact that you have a 13 year old son, I can suggestSafari Park Hotelas my first option. In the past years they have been having dinners, dancers, live bands, dances, fireworks and a lot of other activities. I am sure this year too will be the same. You can call the hotel and confirm.My second option can be Carnivore and third Village Market.",

This way you are sure you are going to be picked up as soon as the flight lands.The choice of hotel then may not necessarily be confined to the proximity of the Airport as you will be dropped to your hotel safely.Having said that there are several options of nearby Airport hotels among them is Panari hotel, Ole Senari relatively new, Hill park hotel, Mvuli Park and many more depending on your budget. At that time it hardly takes twenty min to the city center as its clear all the way hardly any traffic. Its usually twenty Usd one way to the city center in a private transfer cab.

            "body": "You don&#39;t say whether you are transiting or staying longer? There isn&#39;t an airport shuttle bus - some of the better hotels might offer their own transport which you would have to arrange beforehand. The best thing is to order a private cab to wait for you - the driver will meet you at the barriers just outside the customs check at arrivals.As the OPs have mentioned, traffic at that time of the night is negligible, however if you need to return to the airport the next day to catch a flight allow at least 2 hours to get there, especially in the late afternoon or on Fridays. Even if the normal traffic is okay, quite often something happens (like a police shoot out with gangsters, or the presidential calvalcade, or a political speech at the stadium - all of which have happened to me) which stops traffic for hours on end (which means the cab might have trouble even getting to pick you up, let alone deliver you to the airport).If you are staying for a while, choose a hotel near the city or at Westlands - Westlands is safer I reckon, and there are cafes and restaurants there and at the Sarit Centre so you aren&#39;t stuck at the hotel, plus shops and the Maasai markets (in tin sheds on the corner opposite Sarit Centre) to buy some gifts. (The touts at the markets can be quite pushy though, so maybe team up with someone else if possible.)Jacaranda Hotelis fine and doesn&#39;t charge like a wounded bull.Also check TripAdvisor for guesthouses etc - the Mennonite Guesthouse off Rhapta Road is about 40 mins walk from Westlands shops, for example, but don&#39;t walk at night or evening.Andrews Apartments(also a hotel - at the end of Rhapta Road near St Marys schools) is really nice with a quiet green outlook (ask for a room looking over St Marys parkland) and pool, but not sure of their pricing.Also, maybe make a deal with your cab driver to drive you around for your stay - public transport as we know it doesn&#39;t exist, and can be dangerous. I can recommend Francis from Westline Travel (+254 (0) 724 988 866), or Nellion cabs (+254 (0) 734 354 738), or JimCabs. One way trip from JKIA into town/Westlands will be 1500 shillings - this is the standard. Further out (say to Karen) would be more.",

    "body": "Greetings!I will be staying in Nairobi for about 2 months starting in late June. I will also be returning to Nairobi next year for at least 12 months. I am hoping to find an inexpensive room or apartment fairly near the National Museums ofKenyafor this summer and, potentially, for when I move back. I prefer to find a place in a non-ex-pat community or perhaps a homestay. Does anyone know of a good way of finding a place to rent or to share with a family/roommate/student? Are there good ways to get connected or to find postings for apartments from abroad or once I am in Nairobi?Thanks!",

            "body": "There is probably more scope for finding accommodation for the 12 month stay, when you are there for two months. The National Museums are located in the Parklands/Westlands area and the nearest mall, Sarit Centre has a noticeboard where accommodation adverts are posted. The local newspapers also carry ads for accommodation. For longer term property rentals, it is not uncommon for 3 - 6 months deposit to be asked for. Also repainting the accommodation at the end of the tenancy is often a clause in the agreement, which you arrange and fund.I found these, during a quick search:https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/2424954?s=5gsO\u2026capitalfm.co.ke/property/residential-proper\u2026expat-blog.com/en/\u2026flats-for-rent.htmlhttp://www.homestay.com/kenya/nairobiYou have not mentioned your budget, but accommodation in Westlands, particularly can be quite expensive. Cheaper accommodation can be found in other areas of the city, but there is the distance and travel to consider, plus your own personal safety.Edited: 11 June 2014, 10:18",

Couldn&#39;t fault the service. A few tuskers in the garden after we arrived went down very well.For our departure, the chap at reception (I think his name was Felix??) rang through to Safarilink to get them to come and pick us up for our 8 am flight (to Lewa Downs).The main attraction for us was the proximity to Wilson, with a focus on an easy connection with Safarilink. Worked very well, and we are planning to stay there again when we return next year.Hope you enjoy your trip.",

You can also tour Maasai mara , Lake Nakuru or Naivasha , if you have time to do them all. Lake Naivasha is good for walking safari , Lake Nakuru or Naivasha can be done on day trips , Maasai mara is a minimum of 3 days on road safari.Good luck.",

Other highlights are theGiraffe Centrewhere you can feed the giraffes and learn more about them,Karen Blixen Museum(Out of Africa), Bomas of Africa, a cultural village where you will learn about the tribes and watch them perform,Utamaduni Craft Centrefor more up-market crafts. Carnivore Restaurant is also a lot of fun but probably better if you have company. All of these attractions are in Langata an outer suburb of Nairobi, so all close by to each other.I have friends in the safari business in Nairobi who I would recommend to you, but not sure how their cost would compare to other forms of travel for a single person.

Card payments are accepted in many retail outlets, but more remotely located outlets eg. curio shops will operate on a cash basis.Also, I would urge you to pay tips in Kenya Shillings. Kenyan&#39;s are too polite to turn down a tip made in US Dollars. However, the reality is that the member of staff might not be readily able to change the money and will also lose on the exchange, as well as possibly needing to pay for travel to a bank/forex.

And which is the recommended tour operator?4) I have a budget of around USD 650 for 2 days which does not include the ticket cost.

Game drives were excellent.cheersAndrew",

The evening visit from 5-6pm, for those that have adopted ellies, is a different experience and very enjoyable. You get to meet the keepers and see your adopted chubby.Kazuri beads is also great. The tour of the bead making area is very interesting and the ladies very proud of their work. Their finished products are very reasonable in cost here. If you buy the same type of items at lodging, they are way more expensive.Utmanduni Crafts is also in the Karen area and is a great place to have lunch and shop. There is no pressure on the shopping like other places you might encounter. You can browse and bring your items to a central checkout. Prices are slightly higher than booths along the road, but it is wonderful to not have to haggle. They have clean bathrooms and their food is good and very reasonable.Laurena",

As for the Carnivore. . . enormous, no longer does game meat (unless you count chewy crocodile, okay camel and tasty ostrich), but the roast meat does just keep coming, and everyone enjoys themselves.From what you&#39;re saying, if you have the choice, I would stay at the Fairview and try the Blue Nile one evening - they do a so-called &quot;mix dish&quot; where you get to try lots of different food, not just Ethiopian, though that is the main style. Habesha is another Ethiopian place nearby that gets great feedback.Hope that&#39;s a help.Richard",

We would use the car to get from airport to Karen mid-afternoon Friday, and after that maybe to go one place in the area to do some birding if time permits. Early morning to the Park (to be there when it opens) and then if we do not spend the full day in the park to go to one or more of the following:Karura Forest, Ngong Forest,Giraffe Centrenature trail, Arboretum. I am assuming the 1st 3 are easier options wrt traffic. Back to Karen and then early morning to JK airport to be there for 7am (Sunday).Your thoughts appreciated.",

            "body": "Yacht,I supposeBangkokis a fair comparison.If you are only going between Jomo and Karen, with a few trips for birds and NBO Park, I cannot see you encountering any major problems. The Park is off Langata Rd, which is what you will use to get to Keran from Jomo. At the moment there are some works going on there, so it is a little more depressing than usual, but no world shattering.Also, the Park is one of those on the \u2018Card system\u2019, you could actually stop and do all the paperwork the day before going in, thus making entry quicker on the morning you visit. Sometimes there can be a queue at the desk, and anything you can do to avoid it gives you more time actually in there! Ideally, you want to hit the Gate at 0630ish.I would also opt for Ngong over Karuru forest, nothing to do with the birds, I don\u2019t know enough, just that the latter is over by Muthaiga and you\u2019d have to battle through town!If you come out early, and are puckish, there is a reasonable place to eat just by the Gift Shop, then you can get back on the road to theGiraffe Centre, that has a small Caf\u00e9 too, but is really form emergency eats! You may also wish to consider the Elephant Orphange, also in the area, time dependant.For a good feed in the evening, I would head for theTalisman, excellent place about 2 mins from Karen Shops, get your hotel to book a table though, it can get a little busy and try to eat on the Patio, it makes for a nice evening.Do beware, particularly when heading into the road-works on Langata of Matatus, they don\u2019t take prisoners and will when the traffic merges attempt to push you off the road to make space for themselves. For a first time driver over there, I would say bow out gracefully and let them in, it is better than ending up in the ditch.Be lucky and enjoy!",

Also, we want to minimize our touring so we can relax and enjoy GM - any suggestions? We will go to Sheldrick Elephant orphanage in the evening to visit our adoptee - is it worthwhile to also go during the noon public viewing? We will also go to the Giraffe Center.

It is difficult to say exactly where they will be and when as they have the whole garden to explore throughout the day, but it is safe to say that you will see them before 8am up at the Manor and also around tea time when they like to come up again! I have arrived at the manor at various times of the day and there is almost always a giraffe in sight , be it by the Manor or just down the hill.Re: what to do, you can walk to the giraffe centre from the Manor so, as you say this is a must. I would suggest going to the private session only at the Daphne Sheldrick orphanage. This is far more personalised and you will be able to ask specific questions about your elephant as well as seeing some of the others. The afternoon session can have as many as 150 people there and, although interesting for those who are not able to have a private viewing, is not as special. I would suggest that, as your time is short that you only do the private session.Depending on what you are most interested in, whilst you are coming back from the Daphne Sheldrick orphanage I would highly recommend stopping in at Marula studios. This is where they recycle flipflops from the Kenyan coast (they are washed up onto the beach and turtles have been killed by trying to eat them so they are removed and brought to Nairobi). Here they are made into all sorts of wonderful things such as toys, jewellery, mats etc. You can look around the factory and then head into the shop to see the end products. Kazuri beads is great for souvenir shopping and Matt Bronze is great to visit / see the bronzes being made and buy something of quality. Karen Blixen is also nice to see if you are interested in her history, but again, depending on your time you may want to get back to the Manor. You really do not want to miss out on the tea on the lawn with giraffe! Once you are back at the Manor you can enjoy the rest of the day / evening there. What is great is that the Manor is close to all these places, so it really comes down to your own preference. Hope this helps and you have a wonderful time there!",

It&#39;s 28km from Nairobi International Airport and assuming you&#39;re out of the airport and moving in a vehicle by 7.30am (pretty good going if you are), you won&#39;t be at Giraffe Manor until 9 or 9.30am, except possibly on a Sunday. BUT, you won&#39;t be able to check-in until 10.45/11am for the reasons Sandi states - there&#39;s no waiting area, no lobby and they&#39;re checking guests *out* between 10 and 11. So, you&#39;ll be hanging around for a bit, possibly at the AFEW Giraffe Centre itself (to which as guests of GM you would have free access, though possibly only once you&#39;ve checked in\u2026), which is just across the lawn, on the edge of the manor grounds.The bigger question is: if you aren&#39;t already holding a room at Giraffe Manor, book one soon. It&#39;s often full.As for the question of how to fill the 24 hours: &quot;Karen Blixen museum, bomas, Matt Bronze, Kazuki beads, open air market - which one?&quot; Kazuri Beads is nice, but I wouldn&#39;t pass up the opportunity to visitNairobi National Parkproperly - it&#39;s a really impressive 60 square miles of wilderness, not some sanitised city park, and you have a very good chance of seeing lions, and even greater chance (amazingly) of seeing both black and white rhinos.Have a great stay in Nairobi - a greatly underrated city.Richard Trillo",

The recycled flipflop place sounded neat as well.Not sure what you are doing about getting around to these places but we have used the same driver several times and he does a wonderful job. Waits patiently at the airport for us to clear immigration and get visas and helps me plan our day and keeps us on a schedule. The traffic is horrible in Nairobi and you can be stuck for hours, that it why it is necessary to make sure your driver is familiar with the road situation.

There is also Uhuru park which has pedallos, rides etc. Most hotels have swimming pools too so you should be able to fill the time that you are there and most Kenyans do like children - well at least that&#39;s been my experience.",

Bottle water all the way, hats, sunscreen and short days and you will be fine. If you have not already, be sure to visit travel clinic and get antibiotic prescriptions filled ahead for all travellers and take with you for emergency. We were there for 35 days and used ours.Don&#39;t expect to be taking a stroller as it will be useless on the poor roads, sidewalks except maybe in downtown Nairobi. Back pack carrier for that age might be useful. But taxis and guide will get you wherever you need to go so you should not have to carry that much.And to compare, we also went to India for 60 days when youngest was at the around same age as yours.Kenyais much cleaner and safer than crowed India.",

Not all camps/lodges have these as they&#39;re not always necessary, but I sure would for a little one. And for certain be sure to give him/her their malaria meds daily. There are a few types, but Malarone does have a pediatric dosage for child under 40lbs. Discuss with doc meds and inocs that all might need as even most adults haven&#39;t been since childhood - Tetanus, HepA, Polio.Besides forgetting about a stroller, know that most safari vehicles have seat belts but NOT childseats, so you might want to seriously consider one as the roads in some areas aren&#39;t the best. The little one will also often need a nap midday, so having one is best.Also be aware that you can arrange for an anya ( nanny, reasonably priced ) if you wish your own time, as a quiet dinner. Remember though that those younger than 4/yrs rarely remember the experience... sure from photos within a year or two after the trip, but by 6-7/yrs, it&#39;ll be long forgotten.As you&#39;ll have own guide/driver you&#39;ll be able to set your own schedule. While there are pools, whether at NBO hotels or when out on safari, few if any are heated, so keep that in mind.",

We all had it at the same time during one night while on safari and staying in a small cabin so likely spoiled food from a roadside stop on the way there. That was a night to remember for sure with only one bathroom between four of us. Several doses of strong antibiotics, water with electrolytes and soda water and 24 hours later all was fine and forgotten.We loved India as my wife has family there. Travelled the southern third and then the golden triangle. India is great for travel with hiring drivers and cars for ten days at a time and with kids it was much cheaper than private safari in Africa.

However, we were thinking of arriving in Nairobi a few days early and taking in some other experiences. Does anyone have any suggested itineraries or day trips nearby that would be different from the Safari sights we can expect on our formal Safari? This is a once in a lifetime event so our budget is fairly open. We are always interested in meeting and experiencing the people within a new culture. We are intrigued by history but not huge art or artifact museum fans. We are fairly active, like to be on the water and are curious foodies. We have reservations at the Karen Blixen Coffee Garden for the night before our safari we will extend that or could stay somewhere else if you suggest overnighting at a location outside of Nairobi.Any advice would be appreciated.

We also asked our driver to take us to a shopping center so we could buy some snacks and drinks. He also took us by the slums of Nairobi (Kibera). I wish we would have spent more time in the slums. The people there were so friendly and the living conditions were so much different than what we see in America.We also changed money at a bank at the &quot;mall.&quot; This bank had a much better exchange rate than we got at the hotel. Also, it is better to haveKenyashillings for the Elephant orphanage and the Giraffe center. No credit cards accepted and the rate for US money (which they do accept) is far, far worse than if you use their currency.we went to Karen Blixen&#39;s Coffee House for lunch too--such a nice place to eat!!!

    "body": "Hi - we are going to be at Nairobi airport for a very long time when we transit it in August waiting for our international connection. Not good - as we have two kids!Our travel company quoted for a driver to take us out for dinner - but their quote is very expensive. We wondered about getting a taxi to one of the nearby hotels and having a meal there to kill some time. Any comments about the practicality and suggestions about where to go?Also, we have been told that we will need to buy visas to do this. But we will have spent a night in Nairobi a week earlier on the way toMalawi. Surely the visas we have bought to do this would still be valid - or do we need to re-enter the country once we have left?Any help appreciated.",

Similar to The Carnivore much farther into town (consider the traffic); prices similar, most say the food is actually better... all you can eat.If your bags are thru-checked fromMalawithru NBO and homebound, no need to worry. If you have to collect, then you&#39;ll have to pay at restaurant check-room for them to be secure.Take a taxi outside the terminal. Negotiate the price beforehand, which shouldn&#39;t be but maybe $10 if that much. On return to airport, hotel doorman can get you a taxi. Be sure to allow 2/hrs to re-check, Immigration and Security for homebound flight.",

On the other hand, I am considering spending that Saturday night in a Nairobi hotel and then catching a bus on Sunday.Any thoughts/suggestions/recommendations would be greatly appreciated... both about the bus or perhaps about a convenient hotel to stay at for the night in Nairobi if I choose to do that.Thanks!Sam",

If you have never been in Africa before (especiallyKenya), it would be nice for you to travel during the day so you have your bearings. People unfamiliar with their surroundings (it seems) are more commonly victims of crime/petty theft. Not to scare you, but I&#39;ve heard so many stories (and never been a crime victim myself because I&#39;m overly-cautious) so I think you should heed my advise. You would be best-served to take a bus or shuttle the next morning and grab a hotel on Sunday. You will route through Arusha and then onward to Moshi. The Impala shuttle is comfortablehttp://www.impalashuttle.com/and will get you to Moshi. Riverside shuttle is another option, but there have been a few bad reviews on this forum latelyhttp://www.riverside-shuttle.com/.I can&#39;t speak for Scandinavian, as the quality of buses change from year to year or month to month. It used to look decent (haven&#39;t ever taken them myself) but that can change quickly. I like the shuttles, and they are pretty comfortable compared to the buses. Again a bus in Kenya cannot be compared to a bus in the US.Good luck.",

Then back to the Fairview, so traffic shouldn&#39;t be all that much of a factor. And, if the day you are planning this is a Sunday, very little traffic in the morning, though more later in the day.There&#39;s also a nice cafe at Utamaduni Crafts (near Kazuri Beads) at more reasonable prices than Karen Blixen Coffee/Tamambo,(but then lots of cuisine choices in NBO, so whatever you might wish).

They do not do factory tours (which was extremely interesting to me) on Sundays.If this day is following a safari, IMHO, skipping the giraffe center would be an option. You will have seen giraffes already and they will be truly in the wild. A lot of people seem to like the giraffe center because you can touch the giraffe or &#39;get a kiss&#39; from one. But to me, it was more like going to a zoo and it can be quite crowded.Seeing the elephants at the orphanage twice is great (provided as Sandi said you have adopted one) because what they do at the two times is different. I really enjoyed Kazuri and the Karen Blixen estate.",

I only have handluggage, so no waiting for checked luggage.I&#39;d really like to avoid sitting at the airport all that time.How reasonable is it, considering prices, logistics and trafficjams, to visit theNairobi National Park?What can I expect to pay, and what are my options? Is it feasble given the time I have? Should i use an organised safari company or a local taxi?Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I&#39;m from RSA so well familiar with game reserves, the prime viewing times (notusually midday) etc etc..so don&#39;t need advice on that. This is more a question on logistics,costs and option - anything would be GREATLY appreciated!Cheers",

Each site has a small entry free from a few hundredKenyashillings to, I believe, $40 for theNational Park.Leaving the airport during rush hour it can take you a short 45/min (unlikely) or long 2/hrs to get to your first stop for opening, i.e., Nairobi NP.Deplaning, you have to purchase a Transit Visa $20, suggest you withdraw from ATM some local currency to cover your fees, then go out and find a taxi (negotiate the fare for 4/hrs) for driver to take you to these sites, wait for you and return you to airport by 2pm.I&#39;m sure others will have additional input.

The entrance fee to the park is 40$ and the ride to the park and back to the airport will be about 100$.There are no other charges..you can easily beat traffic in the morning by using shorter routes that avoid the city centre direction. the journey back should be smooth as there is no traffic at around 1-2pm headed to the airport.Am sure you can make it.

We came across at least 10 dead buffalo and 1 dead rhino they were moving with bulldozers :( There are not many flamingos there anymore either because the lake is flooded and it&#39;s hard for them to wade in the marshes that were once there. However, the scenery was very green and beautiful.Check out Odyssey Safaris and request Erastus (he is awesome and waited 2 hours for us at the airport!) - they should be able to do a trip tailored to what you request.http://www.odysseysafaris.comEdited: 20 July 2015, 12:42",

I was thinking it may be nice to get out of the city and stay somewhere relaxed on the outskirts.Two questions:- is it actually better to stay in Nairobi and explore, rather than being on the outskirts?- does you have any recommendations or ideas. I&#39;m quite into nature my fianc\u00e9e is into avoiding spiders!Any ideas tips etc etc are very much appreciated.",

Of course the Museum is worth a visit too as are the National archives (sadly overlooked by a lot of visitors). There is also the Bomas and theRailway Museum.For lovers of Nature there are the Animal Orphanage and theSafari Walkall byNairobi National Park. youColud also visit the Karen Blixen House or visit The Sheldrick Centre and many other possibilities available in Nairobi",

For example, places like theGiraffe Centre,Karen Blixen Museum, Elephant Orphanage, Animal Orphanage andNational Parkare all very close to Karen, on the outskirts. If you were to stay somewhere like, say,Macushla House, you would be located in Langata and therefore within 15-20 minutes&#39; driving time of all of the above, traffic permitting. Then, for the downtown attractions such as theNational Museumand others listed in the previous post, you could organise with your hotel / B&amp;B to hire a taxi plus driver for the day to take you into town and wait while you visit them. Alternatively, you could stay in a downtown hotel and do your sightseeing vice versa. Personally speaking, I&#39;d go for the outskirts option as it&#39;s cheaper and quieter and Nairobi, IMHO, is a pretty grotty city!2. For accommodation on the outskirts I would recommend:Macushla HouseNgong HouseGiraffe ManorPalacina Suites/ResidenceHTHFL410",

From well dressed, seemingly rich, people to the desperately poor and needy.You can cross the Equator at over 9000ft and feel cold up there!! You can swim in pools fed by hot springs.........I am a &quot;people person&quot; - most Kenyans are warm hearted and friendly. In your charity work, you are very likely to see needs which may make you a bit uncomfortable doing some touristy things!! If I were you, I&#39;d not make too many plans in advance, unless you want to book a safari. (In that case you can get much advice on this forum.)TIA (This Is Africa) and last minute decisions are the norm, unless it it booking a popular hotel or safari!",

We will be headed to Masai Mara the next morning.

It had been suggested we see the slum (sorry, forget the name) that is one of the largest in Africa. Not that we want to be tourists here but we will be on our way home fromUgandafrom humanitarian work and might find this educational.Thoughts?",

Japanesse - Tokyo in Westlands.I had dinner at Carnivore on Tuesday, and it was not bad. The experience is still great, and the meat is good (tho no exotic meats).Remember that traffic can be heavy in nairobi, so if you arrive in the aftrenoon, the drive from the airport to the hotel could take up to 2 hours. It would not leave too much time for sight seeing. You could go to Karen and see theGiraffe Centre, Karen Blixen&#39;s House, and do a spot of shopping.",

The only reason i suggest this is because you mentioned your work inUganda. Kibera is not for the average &#39;tourist&#39;.Things are quite bad there and the mere size of the place is unbelievable. 1.5 million people living in a &#39;real&#39; slum. It is the largest in all of africa. There is a spot at a school called &#39;olympic&#39; where you can get a great view of Kibera.Despite the conditions the people, especially the kids, are great.If you can find someone a local that is trustworthy get them to take you through. If you can get them to drive you to an area Jamhuri and then it is a 10min walk to Kibera. If you stay on the outer rim and don&#39;t take valuable you will get a better feel than a drive through. Just don&#39;t go at night. During the day you shouldn&#39;t have any probelms as long as you use common sense. I used to walk to the orphange by myself.Gypsygirl8",

The kids will love this. Fee is $50 to adopt an ellee.Then head to dinner. Carnivore is fun. Tamarind, a bit fancier, but food is excellent. Mediterraneo (Italian) is excellent... there are a few of these around NBO. Nairobi has become a &quot;foodie&quot; city, so there are many cuisines you might find of interest.

(about 2-2.5/hrs drive time)OR- Sat morning, road trip to Ol Pejeta, private conservation - stay at Sweetwater&#39;s, Porini Camp or Ol Pejeta Bush Camp (if open in Nov); game drives, night game drives; Sunday, game or walking safaris; return to NBO by evening. (about 2-2.5/hrs drive time).--- Cost for either of these should include: guide/vehicle, park fees, room/tent, meals, game drives and all transfersHope this helps.",

I&#39;d check with Zim Embassy if this inoc is needed which is rather expensive. Also, taxi to/from hotel.And, for a 7:20am flight you have to be at airport for check-in/security at minimum 2/hrs prior departure (it&#39;s an international flight).

It is a lovely business hotel on southwest side of city but situated so as 1/2 hour drive (allow 2 hours before check-in) to airport. I had lunch at outdoor restaurant and a nap. There are some street wares just outside of hotel grounds if you want any last minute gifts. Nairobi can be dangerous (traffic bad) so don&#39;t go out with any valuables or not at all. I learned that everything is negotiable so don&#39;t fall for any of the street scams or high price quotes.

There might be drunk youth but the thing with carnivore is that there can be multiple events going on at the same time so you choose the one that suits you.Most hotels(4 star and 5 star) in Nairobi CBD will also be having dinners and bands but I doubt you will get any firework action there.From what you are looking for and the fact that you have a 13 year old son, I can suggestSafari Park Hotelas my first option. In the past years they have been having dinners, dancers, live bands, dances, fireworks and a lot of other activities. I am sure this year too will be the same. You can call the hotel and confirm.My second option can be Carnivore and third Village Market.",

This way you are sure you are going to be picked up as soon as the flight lands.The choice of hotel then may not necessarily be confined to the proximity of the Airport as you will be dropped to your hotel safely.Having said that there are several options of nearby Airport hotels among them is Panari hotel, Ole Senari relatively new, Hill park hotel, Mvuli Park and many more depending on your budget. At that time it hardly takes twenty min to the city center as its clear all the way hardly any traffic. Its usually twenty Usd one way to the city center in a private transfer cab.

            "body": "You don&#39;t say whether you are transiting or staying longer? There isn&#39;t an airport shuttle bus - some of the better hotels might offer their own transport which you would have to arrange beforehand. The best thing is to order a private cab to wait for you - the driver will meet you at the barriers just outside the customs check at arrivals.As the OPs have mentioned, traffic at that time of the night is negligible, however if you need to return to the airport the next day to catch a flight allow at least 2 hours to get there, especially in the late afternoon or on Fridays. Even if the normal traffic is okay, quite often something happens (like a police shoot out with gangsters, or the presidential calvalcade, or a political speech at the stadium - all of which have happened to me) which stops traffic for hours on end (which means the cab might have trouble even getting to pick you up, let alone deliver you to the airport).If you are staying for a while, choose a hotel near the city or at Westlands - Westlands is safer I reckon, and there are cafes and restaurants there and at the Sarit Centre so you aren&#39;t stuck at the hotel, plus shops and the Maasai markets (in tin sheds on the corner opposite Sarit Centre) to buy some gifts. (The touts at the markets can be quite pushy though, so maybe team up with someone else if possible.)Jacaranda Hotelis fine and doesn&#39;t charge like a wounded bull.Also check TripAdvisor for guesthouses etc - the Mennonite Guesthouse off Rhapta Road is about 40 mins walk from Westlands shops, for example, but don&#39;t walk at night or evening.Andrews Apartments(also a hotel - at the end of Rhapta Road near St Marys schools) is really nice with a quiet green outlook (ask for a room looking over St Marys parkland) and pool, but not sure of their pricing.Also, maybe make a deal with your cab driver to drive you around for your stay - public transport as we know it doesn&#39;t exist, and can be dangerous. I can recommend Francis from Westline Travel (+254 (0) 724 988 866), or Nellion cabs (+254 (0) 734 354 738), or JimCabs. One way trip from JKIA into town/Westlands will be 1500 shillings - this is the standard. Further out (say to Karen) would be more.",

    "body": "Greetings!I will be staying in Nairobi for about 2 months starting in late June. I will also be returning to Nairobi next year for at least 12 months. I am hoping to find an inexpensive room or apartment fairly near the National Museums ofKenyafor this summer and, potentially, for when I move back. I prefer to find a place in a non-ex-pat community or perhaps a homestay. Does anyone know of a good way of finding a place to rent or to share with a family/roommate/student? Are there good ways to get connected or to find postings for apartments from abroad or once I am in Nairobi?Thanks!",

            "body": "There is probably more scope for finding accommodation for the 12 month stay, when you are there for two months. The National Museums are located in the Parklands/Westlands area and the nearest mall, Sarit Centre has a noticeboard where accommodation adverts are posted. The local newspapers also carry ads for accommodation. For longer term property rentals, it is not uncommon for 3 - 6 months deposit to be asked for. Also repainting the accommodation at the end of the tenancy is often a clause in the agreement, which you arrange and fund.I found these, during a quick search:https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/2424954?s=5gsO\u2026capitalfm.co.ke/property/residential-proper\u2026expat-blog.com/en/\u2026flats-for-rent.htmlhttp://www.homestay.com/kenya/nairobiYou have not mentioned your budget, but accommodation in Westlands, particularly can be quite expensive. Cheaper accommodation can be found in other areas of the city, but there is the distance and travel to consider, plus your own personal safety.Edited: 11 June 2014, 10:18",

Couldn&#39;t fault the service. A few tuskers in the garden after we arrived went down very well.For our departure, the chap at reception (I think his name was Felix??) rang through to Safarilink to get them to come and pick us up for our 8 am flight (to Lewa Downs).The main attraction for us was the proximity to Wilson, with a focus on an easy connection with Safarilink. Worked very well, and we are planning to stay there again when we return next year.Hope you enjoy your trip.",

You can also tour Maasai mara , Lake Nakuru or Naivasha , if you have time to do them all. Lake Naivasha is good for walking safari , Lake Nakuru or Naivasha can be done on day trips , Maasai mara is a minimum of 3 days on road safari.Good luck.",

Other highlights are theGiraffe Centrewhere you can feed the giraffes and learn more about them,Karen Blixen Museum(Out of Africa), Bomas of Africa, a cultural village where you will learn about the tribes and watch them perform,Utamaduni Craft Centrefor more up-market crafts. Carnivore Restaurant is also a lot of fun but probably better if you have company. All of these attractions are in Langata an outer suburb of Nairobi, so all close by to each other.I have friends in the safari business in Nairobi who I would recommend to you, but not sure how their cost would compare to other forms of travel for a single person.

Card payments are accepted in many retail outlets, but more remotely located outlets eg. curio shops will operate on a cash basis.Also, I would urge you to pay tips in Kenya Shillings. Kenyan&#39;s are too polite to turn down a tip made in US Dollars. However, the reality is that the member of staff might not be readily able to change the money and will also lose on the exchange, as well as possibly needing to pay for travel to a bank/forex.

And which is the recommended tour operator?4) I have a budget of around USD 650 for 2 days which does not include the ticket cost.

Game drives were excellent.cheersAndrew",

The evening visit from 5-6pm, for those that have adopted ellies, is a different experience and very enjoyable. You get to meet the keepers and see your adopted chubby.Kazuri beads is also great. The tour of the bead making area is very interesting and the ladies very proud of their work. Their finished products are very reasonable in cost here. If you buy the same type of items at lodging, they are way more expensive.Utmanduni Crafts is also in the Karen area and is a great place to have lunch and shop. There is no pressure on the shopping like other places you might encounter. You can browse and bring your items to a central checkout. Prices are slightly higher than booths along the road, but it is wonderful to not have to haggle. They have clean bathrooms and their food is good and very reasonable.Laurena",

As for the Carnivore. . . enormous, no longer does game meat (unless you count chewy crocodile, okay camel and tasty ostrich), but the roast meat does just keep coming, and everyone enjoys themselves.From what you&#39;re saying, if you have the choice, I would stay at the Fairview and try the Blue Nile one evening - they do a so-called &quot;mix dish&quot; where you get to try lots of different food, not just Ethiopian, though that is the main style. Habesha is another Ethiopian place nearby that gets great feedback.Hope that&#39;s a help.Richard",

We would use the car to get from airport to Karen mid-afternoon Friday, and after that maybe to go one place in the area to do some birding if time permits. Early morning to the Park (to be there when it opens) and then if we do not spend the full day in the park to go to one or more of the following:Karura Forest, Ngong Forest,Giraffe Centrenature trail, Arboretum. I am assuming the 1st 3 are easier options wrt traffic. Back to Karen and then early morning to JK airport to be there for 7am (Sunday).Your thoughts appreciated.",

            "body": "Yacht,I supposeBangkokis a fair comparison.If you are only going between Jomo and Karen, with a few trips for birds and NBO Park, I cannot see you encountering any major problems. The Park is off Langata Rd, which is what you will use to get to Keran from Jomo. At the moment there are some works going on there, so it is a little more depressing than usual, but no world shattering.Also, the Park is one of those on the \u2018Card system\u2019, you could actually stop and do all the paperwork the day before going in, thus making entry quicker on the morning you visit. Sometimes there can be a queue at the desk, and anything you can do to avoid it gives you more time actually in there! Ideally, you want to hit the Gate at 0630ish.I would also opt for Ngong over Karuru forest, nothing to do with the birds, I don\u2019t know enough, just that the latter is over by Muthaiga and you\u2019d have to battle through town!If you come out early, and are puckish, there is a reasonable place to eat just by the Gift Shop, then you can get back on the road to theGiraffe Centre, that has a small Caf\u00e9 too, but is really form emergency eats! You may also wish to consider the Elephant Orphange, also in the area, time dependant.For a good feed in the evening, I would head for theTalisman, excellent place about 2 mins from Karen Shops, get your hotel to book a table though, it can get a little busy and try to eat on the Patio, it makes for a nice evening.Do beware, particularly when heading into the road-works on Langata of Matatus, they don\u2019t take prisoners and will when the traffic merges attempt to push you off the road to make space for themselves. For a first time driver over there, I would say bow out gracefully and let them in, it is better than ending up in the ditch.Be lucky and enjoy!",

Also, we want to minimize our touring so we can relax and enjoy GM - any suggestions? We will go to Sheldrick Elephant orphanage in the evening to visit our adoptee - is it worthwhile to also go during the noon public viewing? We will also go to the Giraffe Center.

It is difficult to say exactly where they will be and when as they have the whole garden to explore throughout the day, but it is safe to say that you will see them before 8am up at the Manor and also around tea time when they like to come up again! I have arrived at the manor at various times of the day and there is almost always a giraffe in sight , be it by the Manor or just down the hill.Re: what to do, you can walk to the giraffe centre from the Manor so, as you say this is a must. I would suggest going to the private session only at the Daphne Sheldrick orphanage. This is far more personalised and you will be able to ask specific questions about your elephant as well as seeing some of the others. The afternoon session can have as many as 150 people there and, although interesting for those who are not able to have a private viewing, is not as special. I would suggest that, as your time is short that you only do the private session.Depending on what you are most interested in, whilst you are coming back from the Daphne Sheldrick orphanage I would highly recommend stopping in at Marula studios. This is where they recycle flipflops from the Kenyan coast (they are washed up onto the beach and turtles have been killed by trying to eat them so they are removed and brought to Nairobi). Here they are made into all sorts of wonderful things such as toys, jewellery, mats etc. You can look around the factory and then head into the shop to see the end products. Kazuri beads is great for souvenir shopping and Matt Bronze is great to visit / see the bronzes being made and buy something of quality. Karen Blixen is also nice to see if you are interested in her history, but again, depending on your time you may want to get back to the Manor. You really do not want to miss out on the tea on the lawn with giraffe! Once you are back at the Manor you can enjoy the rest of the day / evening there. What is great is that the Manor is close to all these places, so it really comes down to your own preference. Hope this helps and you have a wonderful time there!",

It&#39;s 28km from Nairobi International Airport and assuming you&#39;re out of the airport and moving in a vehicle by 7.30am (pretty good going if you are), you won&#39;t be at Giraffe Manor until 9 or 9.30am, except possibly on a Sunday. BUT, you won&#39;t be able to check-in until 10.45/11am for the reasons Sandi states - there&#39;s no waiting area, no lobby and they&#39;re checking guests *out* between 10 and 11. So, you&#39;ll be hanging around for a bit, possibly at the AFEW Giraffe Centre itself (to which as guests of GM you would have free access, though possibly only once you&#39;ve checked in\u2026), which is just across the lawn, on the edge of the manor grounds.The bigger question is: if you aren&#39;t already holding a room at Giraffe Manor, book one soon. It&#39;s often full.As for the question of how to fill the 24 hours: &quot;Karen Blixen museum, bomas, Matt Bronze, Kazuki beads, open air market - which one?&quot; Kazuri Beads is nice, but I wouldn&#39;t pass up the opportunity to visitNairobi National Parkproperly - it&#39;s a really impressive 60 square miles of wilderness, not some sanitised city park, and you have a very good chance of seeing lions, and even greater chance (amazingly) of seeing both black and white rhinos.Have a great stay in Nairobi - a greatly underrated city.Richard Trillo",

The recycled flipflop place sounded neat as well.Not sure what you are doing about getting around to these places but we have used the same driver several times and he does a wonderful job. Waits patiently at the airport for us to clear immigration and get visas and helps me plan our day and keeps us on a schedule. The traffic is horrible in Nairobi and you can be stuck for hours, that it why it is necessary to make sure your driver is familiar with the road situation.

There is also Uhuru park which has pedallos, rides etc. Most hotels have swimming pools too so you should be able to fill the time that you are there and most Kenyans do like children - well at least that&#39;s been my experience.",

Bottle water all the way, hats, sunscreen and short days and you will be fine. If you have not already, be sure to visit travel clinic and get antibiotic prescriptions filled ahead for all travellers and take with you for emergency. We were there for 35 days and used ours.Don&#39;t expect to be taking a stroller as it will be useless on the poor roads, sidewalks except maybe in downtown Nairobi. Back pack carrier for that age might be useful. But taxis and guide will get you wherever you need to go so you should not have to carry that much.And to compare, we also went to India for 60 days when youngest was at the around same age as yours.Kenyais much cleaner and safer than crowed India.",

Not all camps/lodges have these as they&#39;re not always necessary, but I sure would for a little one. And for certain be sure to give him/her their malaria meds daily. There are a few types, but Malarone does have a pediatric dosage for child under 40lbs. Discuss with doc meds and inocs that all might need as even most adults haven&#39;t been since childhood - Tetanus, HepA, Polio.Besides forgetting about a stroller, know that most safari vehicles have seat belts but NOT childseats, so you might want to seriously consider one as the roads in some areas aren&#39;t the best. The little one will also often need a nap midday, so having one is best.Also be aware that you can arrange for an anya ( nanny, reasonably priced ) if you wish your own time, as a quiet dinner. Remember though that those younger than 4/yrs rarely remember the experience... sure from photos within a year or two after the trip, but by 6-7/yrs, it&#39;ll be long forgotten.As you&#39;ll have own guide/driver you&#39;ll be able to set your own schedule. While there are pools, whether at NBO hotels or when out on safari, few if any are heated, so keep that in mind.",

We all had it at the same time during one night while on safari and staying in a small cabin so likely spoiled food from a roadside stop on the way there. That was a night to remember for sure with only one bathroom between four of us. Several doses of strong antibiotics, water with electrolytes and soda water and 24 hours later all was fine and forgotten.We loved India as my wife has family there. Travelled the southern third and then the golden triangle. India is great for travel with hiring drivers and cars for ten days at a time and with kids it was much cheaper than private safari in Africa.

However, we were thinking of arriving in Nairobi a few days early and taking in some other experiences. Does anyone have any suggested itineraries or day trips nearby that would be different from the Safari sights we can expect on our formal Safari? This is a once in a lifetime event so our budget is fairly open. We are always interested in meeting and experiencing the people within a new culture. We are intrigued by history but not huge art or artifact museum fans. We are fairly active, like to be on the water and are curious foodies. We have reservations at the Karen Blixen Coffee Garden for the night before our safari we will extend that or could stay somewhere else if you suggest overnighting at a location outside of Nairobi.Any advice would be appreciated.

We also asked our driver to take us to a shopping center so we could buy some snacks and drinks. He also took us by the slums of Nairobi (Kibera). I wish we would have spent more time in the slums. The people there were so friendly and the living conditions were so much different than what we see in America.We also changed money at a bank at the &quot;mall.&quot; This bank had a much better exchange rate than we got at the hotel. Also, it is better to haveKenyashillings for the Elephant orphanage and the Giraffe center. No credit cards accepted and the rate for US money (which they do accept) is far, far worse than if you use their currency.we went to Karen Blixen&#39;s Coffee House for lunch too--such a nice place to eat!!!

    "body": "Hi - we are going to be at Nairobi airport for a very long time when we transit it in August waiting for our international connection. Not good - as we have two kids!Our travel company quoted for a driver to take us out for dinner - but their quote is very expensive. We wondered about getting a taxi to one of the nearby hotels and having a meal there to kill some time. Any comments about the practicality and suggestions about where to go?Also, we have been told that we will need to buy visas to do this. But we will have spent a night in Nairobi a week earlier on the way toMalawi. Surely the visas we have bought to do this would still be valid - or do we need to re-enter the country once we have left?Any help appreciated.",

Similar to The Carnivore much farther into town (consider the traffic); prices similar, most say the food is actually better... all you can eat.If your bags are thru-checked fromMalawithru NBO and homebound, no need to worry. If you have to collect, then you&#39;ll have to pay at restaurant check-room for them to be secure.Take a taxi outside the terminal. Negotiate the price beforehand, which shouldn&#39;t be but maybe $10 if that much. On return to airport, hotel doorman can get you a taxi. Be sure to allow 2/hrs to re-check, Immigration and Security for homebound flight.",

On the other hand, I am considering spending that Saturday night in a Nairobi hotel and then catching a bus on Sunday.Any thoughts/suggestions/recommendations would be greatly appreciated... both about the bus or perhaps about a convenient hotel to stay at for the night in Nairobi if I choose to do that.Thanks!Sam",

If you have never been in Africa before (especiallyKenya), it would be nice for you to travel during the day so you have your bearings. People unfamiliar with their surroundings (it seems) are more commonly victims of crime/petty theft. Not to scare you, but I&#39;ve heard so many stories (and never been a crime victim myself because I&#39;m overly-cautious) so I think you should heed my advise. You would be best-served to take a bus or shuttle the next morning and grab a hotel on Sunday. You will route through Arusha and then onward to Moshi. The Impala shuttle is comfortablehttp://www.impalashuttle.com/and will get you to Moshi. Riverside shuttle is another option, but there have been a few bad reviews on this forum latelyhttp://www.riverside-shuttle.com/.I can&#39;t speak for Scandinavian, as the quality of buses change from year to year or month to month. It used to look decent (haven&#39;t ever taken them myself) but that can change quickly. I like the shuttles, and they are pretty comfortable compared to the buses. Again a bus in Kenya cannot be compared to a bus in the US.Good luck.",

Then back to the Fairview, so traffic shouldn&#39;t be all that much of a factor. And, if the day you are planning this is a Sunday, very little traffic in the morning, though more later in the day.There&#39;s also a nice cafe at Utamaduni Crafts (near Kazuri Beads) at more reasonable prices than Karen Blixen Coffee/Tamambo,(but then lots of cuisine choices in NBO, so whatever you might wish).

They do not do factory tours (which was extremely interesting to me) on Sundays.If this day is following a safari, IMHO, skipping the giraffe center would be an option. You will have seen giraffes already and they will be truly in the wild. A lot of people seem to like the giraffe center because you can touch the giraffe or &#39;get a kiss&#39; from one. But to me, it was more like going to a zoo and it can be quite crowded.Seeing the elephants at the orphanage twice is great (provided as Sandi said you have adopted one) because what they do at the two times is different. I really enjoyed Kazuri and the Karen Blixen estate.",

I only have handluggage, so no waiting for checked luggage.I&#39;d really like to avoid sitting at the airport all that time.How reasonable is it, considering prices, logistics and trafficjams, to visit theNairobi National Park?What can I expect to pay, and what are my options? Is it feasble given the time I have? Should i use an organised safari company or a local taxi?Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I&#39;m from RSA so well familiar with game reserves, the prime viewing times (notusually midday) etc etc..so don&#39;t need advice on that. This is more a question on logistics,costs and option - anything would be GREATLY appreciated!Cheers",

Each site has a small entry free from a few hundredKenyashillings to, I believe, $40 for theNational Park.Leaving the airport during rush hour it can take you a short 45/min (unlikely) or long 2/hrs to get to your first stop for opening, i.e., Nairobi NP.Deplaning, you have to purchase a Transit Visa $20, suggest you withdraw from ATM some local currency to cover your fees, then go out and find a taxi (negotiate the fare for 4/hrs) for driver to take you to these sites, wait for you and return you to airport by 2pm.I&#39;m sure others will have additional input.

The entrance fee to the park is 40$ and the ride to the park and back to the airport will be about 100$.There are no other charges..you can easily beat traffic in the morning by using shorter routes that avoid the city centre direction. the journey back should be smooth as there is no traffic at around 1-2pm headed to the airport.Am sure you can make it.

We came across at least 10 dead buffalo and 1 dead rhino they were moving with bulldozers :( There are not many flamingos there anymore either because the lake is flooded and it&#39;s hard for them to wade in the marshes that were once there. However, the scenery was very green and beautiful.Check out Odyssey Safaris and request Erastus (he is awesome and waited 2 hours for us at the airport!) - they should be able to do a trip tailored to what you request.http://www.odysseysafaris.comEdited: 20 July 2015, 12:42",
