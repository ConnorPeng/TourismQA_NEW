You can get in contact with them and arrange to help with the prep or delivery of meals to those in need. Contrary to the org name, a vehicle is not needed. You will be paired with someone, if you choose to deliver, and given a manifest, cart with the meals and a general area to deliver.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis will usually take(if delivering) under 3 hours.\\n\\n\\n\\nI usually do this for Christmas/NYE....but haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t for Thanksgiving.

A few questions:\\n\\n\\n\\n- Should I prepay? I'm leaning on not since some reviews talk about being stood up by the driver and then having to take a cab.\\n\\n- If I don't pre-pay, can I pay by credit card? I don't like to carry cash these days.\\n\\n- I understand tips, tolls, airport parking fees and rush hour fees are extra. Does the driver provide me with some kind of itemized bill at the end of the ride so I know I'm not being scammed?\\n",

There are 2 animators inside the bus. The tour includes NYPL, Bryant Park, Grand Central, Chrysler Bldg, Madison Ave, Times Square,Columbus Square. The animators keep the passengers engaged with their scripted and some non-scrpted or impromptu jokes. There are 5-6 street performers dedicated to perform for \"The Ride\" passengers. The passengers can clearly hear the performers outside as their microphone is integrated with the speaker system inside the bus. Some pedestrians on the streets wouldn't have any idea that these performers are actually performing for \"The Ride\" passengers because their microphone is not loud enough to attract any attention from the street. Someone might think a random New Yorker is just talking to someone on his hand free phone, but he's actually rapping about anything or anyone he sees on the street. Quite entertaining for the spectators sitting inside the bus. For tourists like us, it's something different and we don't see these things on a daily basis so yeah, it's worth it. Every one had a good laugh. My young teens love it.\\n\\n\\n\\nDowntown Experience is more of an informative tour about the history around Wall St, NY City Hall, Charging Bull, Black Slaves Cemetery, Supreme Court, Brooklyn Bridge, Battery Park, Broadway St, Canal St. The virtual goggle is an added gimmick to watch some re-enactment of scenes in the past that had happened in that particular area like first wave of European migrants etc...There's one street performer who's going to pop up during the tour. Some people find it a bad taste but our family enjoyed it. We did this tour right after our visit from One World Observatory & 9/11 Memorial. The meeting point is near the TKTS South St Seaport.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe had booked these tours as part of our Sightseeing Pass. We felt that it's worth it coz the tour gave us a different variety on our NYC sightseeing experience and a break from walking. We took this ride in early March so we stayed warm the whole time. It's a much better option than the open top decker Hop-On, Hop-Off Bus and Big Bus Tour. I find that native New Yorkers don't recommend these tours so much, but \"The Ride\" and \"Downtown Experience\" are both satisfying for us. Different strokes for different folks!\\n",

From the article, it seems the biggest issue is the price, which, honestly, if you go to Milos, you should not really care about. It is expensive and people who go know that it's expensive.

The original plan was to hopefully check in early and walk down 34th to catch the East River ferry over to Brooklyn spend a few hours there walk the bridge then the comedy show. Plans changed when we were unable to check in right away. I knew if we carried on with our plans we would not be back until now 11:45 p.m. So on to plan B. I've spent months planning, having a plan A plan B plan C if something goes wrong, thank goodness I did. On to plan B. We walked up Fifth Ave, went to the New York Public Library had a peek around in there for about 20 minutes, walkth rough Bryant Park over to Grand Central Terminal where we spent about 20 minutes looking around. Took a few pictures of the Chrysler Building popped in and out of a few shops, walked back to the hotel at 3:00 with fingers crossed that we were hopefully able to get in. As luck would have it we got in!!!!!!\\n\\nWe took our bags up to our room changed our clothes and headed out for the evening. I was determined to catch the East River ferry to Brooklyn so off to Penn Station we went, took the express Subway to South Battery Park and a quick 10-minute walk to pier 11 and we made it. It certainly was not the enjoyable 40-minute boat ride along the east side but it was 10 minutes and we were in Brooklyn. Winson Brooklyn we just walk to Grimaldi's enjoy the pepperoni pizza, FYI it is not licensed anymore. Hubby was dying for a beer so he was a little disappointed, but we sat enjoyed our pizza walked the Brooklyn Promenade made our way to the entrance of the Brooklyn Bridge\\n\\n(Submitting now b4 i lose it again)\\n",

I was able to get some nice pictures and that's what it was about. Now I have walk the Brooklyn Bridge before so I know about people cutting out in front of the bikers and such but OMG was it ever horrible. It was all about the Selfies LOL. A few times I offered to take people's pictures for them because I could see that they were struggling to do so as do I when taking a selfie of my hubby and I! Lol the bridge took about 40 minutes to walk once we exited we were going to go to Canal Street. We made it there but we were getting chilly hubby still really wanted a beer so we stopped in Tribeca at some bar, he had a beer I had a ginger ale and we were good to go. Took a Subway up to Greenwich Village for comedy show at 9:30 we got to the Village around 8 found the place grabbed a coffee and did a walk around, again popped in and out of a few stores and went back to Fat Black Pussycat at 8:45 to wait for our show. There was six comedians one wasn't very good but the other five had us in tears laughing. A wonderful evening, not very expensive $60 four drinks total and the comedy show. That equals a good night in NYC!!! We have walked over 20 miles ( the Fitbit is coming up at 32 km wow) we are both fairly active people we walk all day for work so walking around shouldn't be a problem. I have been to New York a few times before so I was used to the people, how people cross at red lights,walk out in front of traffic, excessive horns on the taxicabs. The hords of people, Etc my husband on the other hand was not ready for that. He could not believe how many people cross the street on their cell phone and Dodge getting hit by cars every time. Look up people be careful!! His first subway ride experience was amazing there was a man on there playing his violin and singing and he was so good I was just in awe of him. I told my hubby it won't be like this every subway ride. So far it has been an amazing day in New York City I hate to call it a night but my body is tired and we have big plans for tomorrow. Tomorrow's goal is American Museum of Natural History, Central Park, Midtown. And Times Square by night.\\n\\nGood night New York City till Tommorws adventures!!!!\\nEdited: yesterday, 09:59 ",

Bryant Park for the Christmas markets and iceskating, and the Library for indoor time and the Children's Room.

It can be really cold and windy there. See what the weather's like and if it's mild keep it in. Maybe even do it on another day so you can go in the middle of the day when it's warmer (but also more crowded). You have the time. Walk around Brooklyn Bridge Park for a while if it's nice out.\\n\\n\\n\\n- Central Park, Museum of natural history, Metropolitan museum.

It's driven by *your* choices, rather than presenting a plethora of places from which to choose. You choose three or more sights and get a discount of up to 20%.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne thing that no pass will tell you is that many sights have \"pay what you wish\" or free times. For instance, the Museum of Modern Art is free on Fridays from 4-8. The American Museum of Natural History is always \"pay what you wish,\" although if you'd like to go to the IMAX theater or Hayden Planetarium or any special exhibit, you must pay full price (and then perhaps a fee on top). The New York Historical Society is pay what you wish on Fridays from 6-8. The Bronx Zoo is free on Wednesdays, and so on.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo I would get a good guidebook first, see what your options are, make a list of the absolutely must see/must do's, then check out their websites to see if they have any free or \"pay what you wish\" hours. Then use a Build Your Own Pass for the rest.\\nEdited: yesterday, 00:20 ",

I rarely wear them (I wore an old Escada blazer last week with a big shawl as an in-between jacket, but it's rare for me).

There is no right or wrong here, so I'm not saying nywhiz or WEQ is wrong - it's personal preference. But the last thing I would wear to an elegant evening is a blazer. I would go sleeveless with probably a sparkly cuff bracelet. If you're cold, a cashmere sweater to throw over your shoulders could work.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen it's cold, I have those arm gloves that I usually take off, but sometimes (rarely) make part of the outfit.

                    "body": "\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom what I understand, Hotels.com is on par with the other well-known third-party booking portals. The big question, however, is why use a third-party booking portal in the first place if you can book directly with the hotel for the same or a lower price? I have yet to book directly with a hotel that wasn't willing to match the quote from a third-party, and many hotels have a low price guarantee if you book direct through the hotel's website. Indeed, with rare exceptions, I have found that the price quote on the hotel's website is the same or lower than the price from the third-party vendor after verifying that the room and all applicable fees are identical. \\n\\n\\n\\nI have also found that third-party booking sites are fine when everything goes right with the reservation, but not so fine when things go wrong, such as a room that does not match the description on the reservation, a room that looks into a dumpster or air shaft , or an unexpected charge on the invoice. In my experience, and from what I have learned from people in the hospitality industry, hotels are much more likely to move the guest to a different room, offer an upgrade, offer perks, or waive fees to resolve problems if the guest booked directly with the hotel (particularly if the guest participates in the hotel's rewards program), than it is if the guest booked through a third-party.\\n",

First on the hotel's site (AAA rate), again when that rate dropped slightly, and now I just re-booked on Booking.com because they had a VERY substantial sale, much lower than the hotel's website. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe only time I've asked for a price match with third party the answer was \"no\". That might not always be the case, but rates are computerized, etc. Plus there could be contractual things involved that prevent the hotel from matching if they push a special promotional sale with a third party site. That's just speculation. It does not surprise me that hotels may not always be able to match the rate they give to a third-party site to promote the hotel.\\n\\n\\n\\nI have mixed feelings about third-party sites. I have never been disappointed with them, but it sometimes feels \"right\" to book directly and I wonder if I will be able to get a better room. Who knows... I often book directly these days.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe plus side of booking with a third-party site is that it is easier to find your booking details, especially if you booked a couple of options, and you are going through their security process to submit your cc info, etc instead of the hotel's own website. Some of those websites are rinky-dink. Even for those that are more professional, do they really have the same security as the giant players like Expedia, Hotels.com, etc?
